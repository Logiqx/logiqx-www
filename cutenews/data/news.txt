1210145376|logiqx|FBA Supplements Fixed!|I noticed that the FBA supplements weren't working properly with the emulator itself.<br />Although FBA supports multiple ROM paths, it doesn't support partial ZIPs (where all of the ROMs are available but are located in more than one ZIP).<br /><br />I've therefore changed the FBA supplements so that complete ZIPs are generated and everthing works fine now.<br />Just make sure that the supplement ROMs are in the first ROM path and MAME / SuperSet ROMs are in subsequent paths.|||1||
