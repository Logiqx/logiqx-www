	<description>ROM manipulation tool that can convert modern day ROMs to older formats</description>

	<comment>
		<p>
			ROMBuild is a ROM manipulation tool that is capable of creating ROMs for the older arcade emus using MAME ones. An example of this is by splitting ROMs in two or joining two together but ROMBuild supports much more than this. It can can split, join, extract, fill, patch, pad, interleave etc but to you the user that doesn't really matter. The important thing is that MAME ROMs go in and ROMs for another emulator come out. :)

			When used in conjunction with the <a href="../../Dats/">CMPro/ROMCenter dats</a> that I have produced you can generate ROM sets for practically any emulator from MAME ROMs. In fact, the only ROMs you can't generate from MAME sets are where MAME doesn't support the game.

			There is also the special version that I created for the Neo-Geo changes around the time of MAME v0.80. The changes affected many emulators but this special release of my tool can build the new type of ROMs from the old ones. In total 23 games were affected, iirc:
