<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Dats are required by ROM managers such as CMPro and RomCenter so that they
can build and audit ROM sets for use in emulators. It is important to ensure
that your dats are correct otherwise the ROM manager cannot do it's job properly
and may actually damage ROM sets. This document and the other supplementary
documents should contain most of the details you need to know about data file creation
and the potential pitfalls. At this time there are two main formats and if you
do decide to create a data file I would urge you to release it in both formats.
Converting from one format to another is very easy using DatUtil so there is
really no excuse for not doing so! </p>

<hr>

<h1>General Guidelines </h1>

<h2>Standards </h2>

<p>MAME uses lower case filenames for arcade ROMs so if you are creating a data
file for a new arcade emulator I would recommend you stick to this convention
(whether or not the ROMs you have use lower case filenames). Lower case
filenames are much easier on the human eye also. </p>

<p>CRCs should be 8 characters long (use leading zeros if necessary), they
should be lower case and not use the prefix '0x'. All of these points are for
the sake of consistency and readability. </p>

<h2>Merging </h2>

<p>Many emulators support ROM merging in order to save on the amount of disk space used.
What this means is that ROMs used by more than one game need only be stored once.
When games can be merged, one of them is called the 'parent' and the others are
called the 'clones'. You cannot have a clone of a clone, only one parent with
one or more clones.&nbsp; </p>

<p>e.g. In MAME there is a game called '1942' which is a parent and
'1942a/1942b' are clones. </p>

<p>There are three types of ROM sets: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-merged is where each game (whether it is a parent or clone) must store
    all of it's ROMs in a ZIP/directory specifically for that game.</li>
  <li>Split-merged is where each parent stores it's ROMs in it's own ZIP/directory but clones only need to store ROMs that are not
    in the parent. Many clones only differ to the
    parent by one or two ROMs so this can lead to significant space savings.</li>
  <li>Fully-merged is where a parent and all of it's clones are stored in a
    single ZIP/directory. This leads to even greater space savings than
    split-merging but the downside is that games are bundled together and this
    is not always advantageous.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an emulator supports ROM merging then the data files you produce should
specify the ROM merging correctly. If you do not specify merging correctly then it not only prevents
people from choosing the merge option they would like but can also cause
misleading scan results. Take PacMan and one of it's clones as an example: </p>

<pre>game (
	name pacman
	description &quot;PuckMan (Japan set 1)&quot;
	year 1980
	manufacturer &quot;Namco&quot;
	rom ( name namcopac.6e size 4096 crc fee263b3 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6f size 4096 crc 39d1fc83 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6h size 4096 crc 02083b03 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6j size 4096 crc 7a36fe55 )
	rom ( name pacman.5e size 4096 crc 0c944964 )
	rom ( name pacman.5f size 4096 crc 958fedf9 )
)

game (
	name npacmod
	description &quot;PuckMan (harder?)&quot;
	year 1981
	manufacturer &quot;Namco&quot;
	<b>cloneof pacman
	romof pacman</b>
	rom ( name namcopac.6e <b>merge namcopac.6e</b> size 4096 crc fee263b3 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6f <b>merge namcopac.6f</b> size 4096 crc 39d1fc83 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6h <b>merge namcopac.6h</b> size 4096 crc 02083b03 )
	rom ( name npacmod.6j size 4096 crc 7d98d5f5 )
	rom ( name pacman.5e <b>merge pacman.5e</b> size 4096 crc 0c944964 )
	rom ( name pacman.5f <b>merge pacman.5f</b> size 4096 crc 958fedf9 )
)</pre>

<p>It can be seen that npacmod only has one ROM that differs from the parent set
so some people may be tempted to create a data file that forces split sets by
doing this: </p>

<pre>game (
	name pacman
	description &quot;PuckMan (Japan set 1)&quot;
	year 1980
	manufacturer &quot;Namco&quot;
	rom ( name namcopac.6e size 4096 crc fee263b3 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6f size 4096 crc 39d1fc83 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6h size 4096 crc 02083b03 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6j size 4096 crc 7a36fe55 )
	rom ( name pacman.5e size 4096 crc 0c944964 )
	rom ( name pacman.5f size 4096 crc 958fedf9 )
)

game (
	name npacmod
	description &quot;PuckMan (harder?)&quot;
	year 1981
	manufacturer &quot;Namco&quot;
	rom ( name npacmod.6j size 4096 crc 7d98d5f5 )
)</pre>

<p>Even though this would work to a degree it is a bad idea for two reasons: </p>

<ol>
  <li>ROM managers will report npacmod as working if just the one ROM
    (npacmod.6j) is
    present. If any of the necessary parent ROMs are missing it should
    report a problem for npacmod but cannot (since you removed the information it needs).</li>
  <li>It forces people to use split sets when they might want to fully merge
    their ROMs (or not merge them at all).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, people may be tempted to create a fully merged data file as
follows: </p>

<pre>game (
	name pacman
	description &quot;PuckMan (Japan set 1) and <b>PuckMan (harder?)</b>&quot;
	year 1980
	manufacturer &quot;Namco&quot;
	rom ( name namcopac.6e size 4096 crc fee263b3 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6f size 4096 crc 39d1fc83 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6h size 4096 crc 02083b03 )
	rom ( name namcopac.6j size 4096 crc 7a36fe55 )
	rom ( name pacman.5e size 4096 crc 0c944964 )
	rom ( name pacman.5f size 4096 crc 958fedf9 )
	<b>rom ( name npacmod.6j size 4096 crc 7d98d5f5 )</b>
)</pre>

<p>This too would be incorrect for three reasons: </p>

<ol>
  <li>It forces people to fully merge their ROMs when they may want split-merged
    sets.</li>
  <li>There is no way to know which ROMs are required for any one game.</li>
  <li>The ROM manager will report the wrong number of games (1 instead of 2).</li>
</ol>
<p>If an emulator only supports one of the three merging options then you can
specify it in a CMPro data file using the 'forcemerging' option in the header.
Do not create a data file containing incorrect merging information. It is a terrible
sin! </p>

<p>The syntax for specify merging information is detailed in the <a href="CMPro.shtml">CMPro</a> and <a href="RomCenter.shtml">RomCenter</a>&nbsp;format
documents. </p>

<h2>Special CRCs </h2>

<p>There are some special CRCs used by ROM managers and at times you may find
them useful: </p>

<ul>
  <li>00000000 CRCs should be used when a ROM name and size is known but the ROM
    is unavailable (i.e. the CRC unknown).</li>
  <li>Complemented CRCs should be used to indicate that a ROM is known to be
    incorrect but is the best available at the time (MAME uses complemented CRCs to
    represent other things as well). The only time I have ever had to use
    complemented CRCs is for the Virtua data file; where some ROMs are known to
    be half the correct size but have not been re-dumped since. Specifying the
    available ROMs using complemented CRCs is the best thing to do until they
    are re-dumped.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note: 00000000 CRCs should not be used in RomCenter datafiles to
list non-dumped games. If a
game hasn't been dumped then you can neither know the ROM names or their sizes.
So, if a game hasn't been dumped yet then don't put it in a data file (after
all, a data file is to identify and validate ROMs). If you want to document
non-dumped games then provide a little text file with your data file! </p>



<h2>Samples </h2>



<p>If an emulator uses sound samples then you can also include this information
in a CMPro data file. At this time it is not possible to put this information
into RomCenter so a dedicated 'samples' data file is a sensible option if the
samples are not packaged with the emulator itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<hr>

<h1>Creating a Data File </h1>

<h2>Use CMPro as Your Master Format! </h2>

<p>I would seriously recommend that you do all of your data file creation in
CMPro format and convert to RomCenter afterwards. The main reason for this is
because is is easier to read, less prone to errors during editing and you will spot more mistakes
too. Once a data file has been loaded into CMPro and is known to be free of
errors it will convert to RomCenter format without problems. </p>

<h2>Scanning Directories/ZIPs </h2>

<p>The quickest way to create a data file from a set of ZIP files is to scan the
ZIPs using a data file creation tool. There are two options: </p>

<ul>
  <li>DataMa (by Eric Bole-Feysot) to generate a RomCenter data file then use
    DatUtil to convert it to CMPro format.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.logiqx.com/DatUtil/DatUtil.shtml">DatUtil</a> has a directory/ZIP scanner facility that can save in CMPro and
    RomCenter format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that certain versions of DataMa produce errors such as the inclusion
of incorrect merging information or an incorrect version in the header (which
will
confuse DatUtil later on). These errors will stand out when you try to convert
the RomCenter data file to CMPro format. Make the necessary corrections to your
CMPro data file then convert back to RomCenter format when you are done (for a
correct data file).</p>
<p>You should be cautious when scanning directories or ZIPs because you could
end up including files that do not belong in the data file (readme files, jed
files, etc.).
The filenames could also be a mixture of upper and lower case whereas it has
already been mentioned that use of lowercase is preferable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Creating by Hand (i.e. Text Editor) </h2>

<p>When creating a data file for an emulator where the games are already
emulated by MAME (or any other emulator for that matter), it is generally a good
idea to copy and paste the ROM details from the existing emulator's data file.
This can either be done manually (copy and paste) or using the '-g' option of
DatUtil. </p>

<p>When maintaining data files for the CPS-2 emulators I tend to copy and paste
games directly from the CPS-2 data file. After using the data file in CMPro/RomCenter
I then check that the game works correctly in the emulator. </p>

<h2>Use Data File Headers</h2>

<p>Both the CMPro and RomCenter data files have headers to specify details such as the
emulator name, version number, data file author, etc. Both emulators use this
information so you should fill it in correctly. An explanation of the various
fields is within the <a href="CMPro.shtml">CMPro</a> and <a href="RomCenter.shtml">RomCenter</a>&nbsp;
sections of this document.</p>

<p>The header file of a CMPro data file can also specify the type ROM merging
required by the emulator (non-merged, split-merged or fully-merged).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Include Merge Information</h2>

<p>ROM merging has been discussed earlier in this document so make sure you
do it correctly!</p>

<hr>

<h1>Converting Between Formats</h1>
<p>To convert data files from one format to another use DatUtil. This will
convert all of the game information and header information for you and if your
data files are correct there will be no problems at all with this procedure.</p>
<p>When attempting to convert some RomCenter data files to CMPro format there
are two common faults that can cause problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An incorrect version number in the header (2.00 used in a 1.92 format
    datafile)</li>
  <li>Some v1.92 data files are missing the ¬N¬O fields before the size
    field.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get around these problems you must fix the RomCenter file by hand.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Testing</h1>
<h2>Checking Data Files for Errors</h2>
<p>There are a variety of methods you can use to test your data file for
syntactical, logical and lexical errors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load the CMPro format data file into CMPro itself as it will report some
    logical errors (invalid parents, duplicated ROMs, etc.).</li>
  <li>Run it through DatUtil (i.e. CMPro&lt;-&gt;RomCenter) then convert it back
    again. DatUtil will report anything that looks odd in the data file and the
    resultant data file should also match the original perfectly (use DatUtil to
    compare against the original).</li>
  <li>Convert to RomCenter 1 format ('-f romcenter' in DatUtil) as that will
    strip out some complex merging definitions. If the RomCenter dat doesn't
    match the original (use DatUtil to compare) then you may have unintentially
    messed up the merging information.</li>
  <li>Try the 'fix merging' option of DatUtil ('-m' flag). The end result should not
    differ from your original data file or you have probably got the original
    merge information wrong (use DatUtil to do the comparison).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use DatUtil to Check Against the Emu!</h2>
<p>If the emulator can generate it's own data file or the emulator is natively supported by
DatUtil then make use of this fact. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> WinKawaks can generate a RomCenter data file. Use DatUtil to check your
    data file against the one generated by WinKawaks (this can identify errors
    in your data file and WinKawaks itself).</li>
  <li>Calice drivers are supported by DatUtil. Concatenate the drivers together
    ('cat *.drv &gt;drivers.txt') then use DatUtil to compare them against your
    data file ('datutilx drivers.txt calice.dat').</li>
</ul>
<p>If the emulator can't generate it's own data file then you may have to resort
to a hex editor if you want to check ROM names! Before using the hex editor,
make sure that you decompress the executable if it has been packed with UPX (use
the '-d' option of UPX).</p>
<h2>Build a ROM Set</h2>
<p>Create a complete ROM set using CMPro then scan it with CMPro and/or
RomCenter.</p>
<h2>Scan a ROM Set</h2>
<p>Try scanning what you think is a clean ROM set using both CMPro and RomCenter.
Both should scan the set perfectly and not produce contradictory results. Do not
just scan with RomCenter as it is not as strict as CMPro and you may miss some
errors in your data file as a result.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Checking a ROM Set from the Emulator </h2>
<p>Some emulators will include a ROM audit feature. Run this over the set
that was produced by your data file. If there is no audit feature then the only
way to be sure the sets are correct is to load every game! </p>
<p>When using an emulator to check sets I would highly recommend that you use
split-merged sets (assuming the emulator supports them). If a split-merged set
works without problems then you can be sure that a fully-merged or non-merged
set will also work (the reverse is not true however).&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Checking MAME Compatibility </h2>
<p>This is not really necessary but can be of interest. If you wish to know
whether an emulator is 100% MAME compatible then do these two tests using CMPro:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan a MAME set with the data file for the other emulator. This should
    only report unneeded ROMs so if you disable 'show unneeded' then the scan
    results should be empty.</li>
  <li>Use a MAME data file to scan a ROM set for the other emulator. This should
    only report missing ROMs (so disable 'show missing' for empty scan results)
    and a few games may also be reported as 'wrong name' (when a similar game is
    supported by the other emulator).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If either scan shows any other kind of errors (i.e. wrong filename for
a ROM), then there is probably some incompatibility.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Problems Encountered</h1>
<p>Now and then you may encounter something that is difficult to represent
accurately in a ROM manager data file.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Missing Parents</h2>
<p>Sometimes an emulator will support a clone (or clones) but not the parent
game itself. If the emulator searches a parent directory/ZIP when loading ROMs
then it may be advantageous to include the parent game in the data file as well
(rather than make the clone(s) standalone games with no parent defined). The ROM
manager will report more games than are actually supported by the emulator but
it does have the big advantage that a MAME-compatible emulator can have a MAME compatible
data file (whereas removing the parent/clone relationship would
prevent this). This is common in the data files for the CPS-2 emulators because
parent games are not always decrypted before the clones. </p>
<h2>Impossible Merging</h2>
<p>Occasionally an emulator may use the same filename for two ROMS in a parent
and clone where the ROMs themselves differ (i.e. same name but different CRC).
This would obviously cause a problem within a ROM manager because it is
physically impossible to create a fully merged ROM set.
The only way to solve this is to remove the parent/clone relationship until such
time as the emulator is changed to use different ROM names. </p>
<p>Note: RomCenter will report an error in any data file that contains
conflicting CRCs in parents and clones.&nbsp; </p>
