<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Although MAME is capable of creating a CMPro data file using the '-listinfo' option
it is sensible to clean up the output using DatUtil, thereby removing redundant
information and making it more readable. Also, if you try to use the listinfo
output directly with CMPro or RomCenter you will end up with slightly differing
behaviour from the two tools (for a few games) due to merging of ROMs with
different names. The way to avoid this difference in behaviour is to use the
'fix merging' feature of DatUtil.

<h1>Data File Creation</h1>

<h2>Creating the MAME Data File</h2>

<p>1) First thing you want is a 'clean' CMPro dat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mamew -listinfo &gt;mame.dat</li>
  <li>datutilx -m -f listinfo mame.dat</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the DatUtil 'fix merging' option ('-m' flag) is used.</p>
<p>2) Now you need to load the data file into CMPro and correct all errors as they are
reported. The errors reported will always be 'double ROMs' but if you don't get
any reported then you have the warning option switched off (so switch it on). Correct
the data file as each error is reported then reload it afterwards to check all errors
have been corrected.</p>
<p>3) The CMPro data file should now be perfect so convert it to RomCenter format
using DatUtil.</p>
<h2>Creation of 'Changes' Data Files</h2>
<p>You will need the MAME data file from the previous MAME version in order to do
this. When you have both data files to hand, use the MAMEDiff options -S, -M and -N to
create data files the three set types. I do all of this generation
using a 'makefile' (C programmers will know what that is) but a simple .bat
script could be used to save effort when a new MAME release comes out.</p>

<h1>Note</h1>
<p>It is very important to use the 'fix merging' option of DatUtil otherwise a
set that scans cleanly with one tool will report errors in the other (unneeded
ROMs or missing ROMs usually)!</p>
