<p align="left">MAMEDiff makes it easy to identify ROM related changes in a new release of
MAME (it can even find game additions that aren't mentioned in whatsnew.txt). It can spot
game renames and will not regard them as one game deleted and another added. When ROMs or
games are renamed (or if there is a change in the way that sets are merged), MAMEDiff will
just tell you how to rebuild the affected sets (i.e. no downloading required). A must-have
for any MAME fanatic! It also works for new releases of MESS, RAINE, Final Burn
Alpha, Kawaks, etc.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>19 May 2003</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.17</p>

<p align="center">Fixed so that the missing konamigx resource in MAME v0.67 doesn't cause a crash!<br>

<p align="center"><strong><u>18 January 2003</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.15</p>

<p align="center">  Increased line buffer size to 32KB (for those people who end
up with MAME history in their listinfo).<br>
                   Added knowledge of the Sega ST-V BIOS.</p>

<p align="center"><u><strong>14 November 2002</strong></u> - MAMEDiff v1.14</p>

<p align="center">  Required some improvements for MAME v0.62:<br>
                   Added support for the SKNS resource.<br>
                   Improved merge handling (required by European SKNS games).<br>
                   Does not output empty year information to mamediff.dat.<br>
                   Made a minor change to improve compatibility with MSVC++.</p>

<p align="center"><u><strong>20 May 2002</strong></u> - MAMEDiff v1.13</p>

<p align="center">  Automatically detects and handles new resource ROMs.<br>
                   New resource ROMs are now included in the -t/-T output.</p>

<p align="center">  <u><strong>22 April 2002</strong></u> - MAMEDiff v1.12</p>

<p align="center">  Added support for the PGM resource.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><u><strong>4 April 2002</strong></u> - MAMEDiff v1.11</p>

<p align="center">  Made internal 'fix-merging' logic check CRC as well as name.<br>
                   Increased maximum ROM name length to 20 (for neopong).<br>
                   Minor fix relating to ROM names that are too long.<br>
                   Exits gracefully when the maximum no of games/ROMs reached.</p>

<p align="center"><u><strong>17 March 2002</strong></u> - MAMEDiff v1.10</p>

<p align="center">  Fixed bug with last version where standard compare refused to start (affected -v as well).</p>

<p align="center"><u><strong>15 March 2002</strong></u> - MAMEDiff v1.09&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">  Added the -t and -T options (brief description below).<br>
                   Made CRCs case insensitive.<br>
                   Minor fix to -v output.</p>

<p align="center"><u>Explanation of the -t and -T options</u></p>

<p align="center">In addition to the -M, -S and -N options that produce CMPro dats of changed
ZIPs, you can produce 'tiny' versions of the dats. This allows you to create a small supplementary dat for the new emulator that when added to the original
set is 100% suitable for the new emulator (i.e. for emulators that support multiple ROM paths).</p>

<p align="center">Not only can these options be used when upgrading from one version of an emu
to another but they can even be used when trying to use ROMs of one emulator with another (e.g. trying to use MAME ROMs with RAINE, Kawaks or Nebula). When
used in this way you can use a standard MAME ROM set and a small emulator specific 'supplementary' ROM set for the emulator of your choice.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>10 February 2002</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.08</p>

<p align="center">Improved the -M, -S and -N options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="center">The dats generated now include resource information so that CMPro can separate out Standard/Neo-Geo games etc.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="center">The non-merged dat now doesn't include 'merge' information
    in games where the parent isn't included in the dat.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">Modified source to compile easily with CygWin (and FreeBSD?).</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>7 May 2001</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.07</p>

<p align="center">Minor fix: Removes unneeded 'romof' details with -S and -N.<br>

Can also be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>24 March 2001</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.06</p>

Minor: Now ignores RAINE and clrmamepro headers.<br>
Minor: Compiled with -Wall (fixed all warnings it uncovered).</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>11 March 2001</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.05</p>

<p align="center">Tiny fix to exclude resources from the game and ROM totals.</p>

ROMs added to parent set are also reported for clone too.<br>
Now spots merge changes at the same time as CRC compliment.<br>
Added '-c' option to assist with the maintenance of CAESAR.<br>
Included source, do not abuse!<br>
Internal change: max of 32 flags instead of 16 (int-&gt;long).<br>
Internal change: strcpy-&gt;strncpy to avoid memory problems.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>28 July 2000</u></strong> - MAMEDiff v1.03</p>
