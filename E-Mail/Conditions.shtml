<p align="center">If you want to e-mail me then please make sure that it is not
about one of these subjects:</p>

<p align="center"><b>Where arcade ROMs are available for download.<br>
</b>I don't know so don't waste your time or mine by asking!</p>

<p align="center"><b>'How To' questions because you are new to emulation.<br>
</b>Sorry but my spare time is limited so I don't have time to teach people the
basics.<br>
I would recommend a visit to the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/easyemu/">EasyEmu</a>
website.</p>

<p align="center"><b>How to use MAME, Kawaks, Nebula (or any other emulator for
that matter).<br>
</b>The same answer as immediately above.<b><br>
</b>The emulator documentation is generally very good and the common emulators
are explained at <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/easyemu/">EasyEmu</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Neo-Geo (SNK) and CPS-2 (Capcom) fighting games.<br>
</b>I have no great interest in these systems so please don't bother me about
them.</p>

<p align="center">If you wish to contact me on any other matters then feel free
to <a href="E-Mail.shtml">e-mail</a> me.</p>
