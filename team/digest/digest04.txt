yeah, you use: datutil -g name -a "dat_you_create" "dat_the_info_comes

And you do same batch, (for instance - as I did - i have created .bat

Cool.

> I have used your tool to compare it to the drivers:

I have uploaded a new 'Nebula' directory to the same place as yesterday:

ftp://leslaw:leslaw@149.156.75.202:2121/TEAM_LOGIQX/Dats/Recent/Multi/Nebula
.zip

This contains the new dat by SLA (with a few mods which I will explain
below) and modified scripts that compare it to my fixed drivers (hence, no
errors reported). Please can everyone interested in Nebula dats download
this and have a play. :)

> Let me know what do you think.

I changed the sf2m ROMs to use the correct s92 names (as discussed with
Stefan yesterday) and also fixed ElSemi's drivers to match. I will send it
to him shortly.

Also, since I was editing the dat I removed the comments that the first
three games had (not working, etc) since these would look strange in CAESAR
and aren't really part of the game name anyway. The emulator can tell people
that they don't work. ;)

ZIPs and .ent.xml so that I (or other members of the team) can check them
before an upload.

_upload.bat is only for the site maintainer (currently me) otherwise old
dats or web pages may get uploaded by someone without everything on their
machine fully up to date. You'll notice that it uses environment variables
for the login and password so this prevents people accidentally running it
(it won't run if they are not configured). ;)

Pipes take the output of each command and send it to the next. The 4
commands are:

1) grep 'name:' mamediff.2.log - extracts all lines containing 'name:' from
mamediff.2.log
2) sed 's/.*name: //' - removes 'name: ' from each of those lines
3) sed 's/ .*//' - removes the first space and everything after it from
those lines
4) sed 's/].*//' - removes the first ] and everything after it from each
line

After the 4 commands, you are left with just the game names from
mamediff.2.log

I will test Nebula properly tonight (when I get home to my roms) and then
upload to the site. Is there any chance that you could put the new
sf2m-x.zip files on the FTP for me?

Cheers, Mike

It's even simpler than that for Calice and Nebula drivers. You just 'cat'
the files together then run one DatUtil command (no scripting necessary).

Yes, we do know which files are needed. The drivers are correct which is why
I use them in my comparison scripts. As Ben Jos says, they do miss out the
Neo-Geo resources but that is all (ignoring the complication of inherited
ROMs in CPS-2 clones... clever but annoying). Fixes that I make are for ROM
naming errors or incorrect CRCs only.

sure, roms are in Team_Logiqx.

I have built a whole set for nebula, and run automatic check - all
greens.

I have also struggling with moving to the end "neocd.zip" - since it
is not a game - just bios.
othrewise all games are alphabetically.

In the case of the Nebula dat it is safe to do either but it is worth

I'm glad that Nicola stressed the point about the non-profit, non-commercial
nature of MAME.  It wasn't until my gf's dad was preparing to launch his own
site that I really saw the corporate view.  He was interested in page layout
and design, so I showed him a few of my faves including CAESAR (woo!  home
team!).  He asked me, "So how do they make any money?", and I answered,
"They don't."  This seemed to confuse him.  The idea of big effort within a
commercial environment (his view of the net) and without any hope of cash
rewards was simply too alien for him.  If the IDSA and their member
companies would only realize that we're not making any money (in many cases
*cough* romsites *cough* quite the opposite) and not even trying to do so,
and that no real revenue of theirs is being threatened, perhaps they might
back off and concentrate on, say, those douchebags in Hong Kong (?) whose
commercial product rips off MAME and the copyright holders.

Enough politics.

I'll be an intern until early January, but I don't see a problem with

On the dat side of life, I'm going to redo all the lessons and exercises - I
understand that there have been some changes and updates.  I also skipped

They should be easier to follow now. All of the problems caused by differing
windoze machines have been ironed out (I think/hope). As far as I can
remember, the only things that will be incorrect are links to Dats.zip,
Dat_RC.zip and WWW.zip. For one, they are no longer ZIP files (now .tar.gz
format) and they are also best downloaded from Leslaw's FTP (rather than
logiqx.com - due to bizarre download problems).

If "Apprentice" and a "1" on 'Dat Complexity" mean that I haven't taken any
lessons yet, then, yes, I guess that's what I am. If it is meant as a more
general description (regardless of the Logiqx environment while "doing"
.dats), then I am more experienced than that, yes.

I have set up the environment. I already had Cygwin installed, but I wasn't
sure I had the latest version, so I ran setup for that one again. I've
downloaded the first few lessons. I've read through some of the things on
the
team page. And I have read through the digests. I'm planning on actually
doing
the lessons soon.

Hmm... I think I'm actually the OLDEST on the team, but let's not talk about

It's OK. I've long since accepted that my Barbie games will haunt me for the

De: "Ben Jos Walbeehm" <walbeehm@walbeehm.com>
Responder a: teamlogiqx@emuverse.com

A: <teamlogiqx@emuverse.com>

As I mentioned in my introduction, I have written a program that uses my
database to create zip files from any given CMP-compatible dat. As part of
that program, I wrote a parser for dat files. That parser also does some
error
checking and optimisations. When I tried to create a set (well, without
writing the actual zips, just to get a log file showing me what, if
anything,
I'm missing) from the Calice v0.6.4.dat file, I got the following from the
parser part:

INFO: Set "sfzch". ROM "sfza20". Merging with parent's ROM "sfz.06".
ERROR: Set "ssf2t". ROM "sfxu.03c". Conflict of same name but different CRCs
between set and parent/clone.

The first line shows that sfza20 can be merged with its parent's sfz.06 ROM,
so a line like

  rom ( name sfza20 merge sfz.06 size 524288 crc 806e8f38 )

could replace the sfza20 line in the sfzch set. I don't know if Calice loads
by CRC, though. If not, then this would probably cause problems and the line
should then be left as it was. Ideally, of course, sfza20 should just be
renamed to sfz.06.

The second line refers to the fact that two clones of ssf2t (viz. ssf2t and
ssf2tu) each contain a ROM called sfxu.03c, but that they have different
CRCs.
Another problem when using fully merged sets. So at least one of them should
really be renamed to resolve this. If Calice loads by CRC, then I guess we
can
take it upon ourselves to rename these and notify the author, similar to
what
was done for Nebula? Although I seem to remember e-mailing Mike quite a
while
ago and getting a reply that was something like that the Calice author
(David?) is not very prompt in fixing things like that, if he fixes them at
all. As for renaming: In Kawaks, the one in ssf2t is called sfxe.03c, while
the one in ssf2tu is still called sfxu.03c. No conflict there.

At this point, my program stops on the first error it encounters, so it
doesn't list the other conflicts (for instance sfxu.04a) within these
clones.
It might be useful if I made a standalone parser that only parses and does
not
stop on the first error it encounters? I know that DatUtil parses and does
validity checks as well, but it may be a good idea to have a second way of
checking?

Cheers,
Ben Jos.

Just out of curiosity: Is there any particular reason why there isn't an
"official Logiqx" dat for MAME's test drivers (drivers remarked out in
MAME's
source code)? It's pretty easy to enable those drivers, compile MAME, and do
a -listinfo to get all the information needed for those games.

Cheers,
Ben Jos.

Good spot. It is unfortunate that DatUtil 'fix merging' does not highlight
these faults in Calice. Calice does not load by CRC so this is what must be
done:

> INFO: Set "sfzch". ROM "sfza20". Merging with parent's ROM "sfz.06".

Since the ROM names are different, fix merging chooses not to merge them. We
should correct the sfzch driver (to use the sfa ROM name) and change the
Calice dat accordingly.

> ERROR: Set "ssf2t". ROM "sfxu.03c". Conflict of same name but different
CRCs
> between set and parent/clone.

Again, DatUtil fix merging does not spot this. The fix merging fixes merging
across a parent and a clone (reports conflicts at the same time) but not
work across two clones. We should fix the Calice driver containing the wrong
ROM name (use CPS-2 dat as reference) and change the Calice dat accordingly.

Agreed. Your findings prove this point. :)

Anyone want to take up this work?

I don't recall exactly but there were several reasons when I considered it,
some of which were:

- ROMs in testdrivers are not always known to be good
- ROMs in a 'just-enabled' driver are often different to the ones when it
was a testdriver
- Not all testdrivers compile easily (how much effort should be put into
compiling it)
- Many testdrivers do not do anything useful
- Some of the ROMs are unavailable to the public

In the end I decided it was too much trouble for drivers that often don't do
anything, may not be the correct ROMs and are hard to find. ;)

On the other hand, now there are more resources available at logiqx.com
(i.e. a team and not just me), someone on the team may like to take it on.
:)

I made a standalone program based on my CMP-dat parser that simply parses a
dat and checks for certain errors and possible optimisations. It does not
stop
now after the first error it encounters. I called it ValiDat. Attached are
the
things it found in the latest Calice and Nebula dat files. As for the last
line in the Nebula log file ("resource is parent"): In my parser, I don't
allow a resource (such as neogeo) to be a parent of something else. The
reason
it gives this error message is that neocd has a "cloneof neogeo" line in it
in
addition to the "romof neogeo" line.

Zip containing logs attached.

I made ValiDat more informative. In case there is a second set involved, it
now also gives the name of that second set. I then used it to check a bunch
of
dat files that were updated recently. The log file lists the names of the
dat
files that were checked and the problems it found.

I know that most people running emulator related sites state something like
"Do not ask me for ROMs". Very understandable. What about "internally",
though? Is asking for some ROM on the TeamLogigx mailing list frowned upon
as
well? Well, I noticed Mike doing it the other day, but maybe he's above the
law. :-)  The reason I ask is that Leslaw and I have helped each other in
the
past completing some of our sets and I am actually running a "secret" FTP

stuff...

Sharing amongst ourselves is fine since it helps us to do our jobs. We
should not mention that we do it to anyone off the team though (although
most people would assume it happens, we do not want to admit to such things
unnecessarily). I think it is wise not to talk about ROM sharing on message
boards or IRC. By all means share ROMs with selected friends but I don't
wish to associate the team with widespread ROM giving. ;)

I'll look at them when I get a chance. I do not think that any of those
emulators load by CRC though so merging isn't possible when ROMs have
different names.

I've completed lessons 0 and 1. I was going to say that "ls" doesn't work
from
a command prompt unless you have an "ls" executable, but then I found out I
should have included C:\cygwin\bin in my path. :-)

I like how you generate a bunch of .dat files within a few seconds. :-)

One thing, though... -listinfo isn't always fully correct. For instance, I
remember that 0.55 had a problem with gotya and thehand. thehand had a
"sampleof gotya" while gotya had a "cloneof thehand". What do you do in
those
cases?

Anything you or anyone else wants to have in the team page for others, as
long as
it's related to the team's purposes, can be sent directly to me and I'll
upload it
for everyone.
Certainly this util of yours HAS TO go up there! I'm sure Logiqx will

Nebula - Fixed, will release publically in due course (maybe when the next
version of the emulator is released).

Kawaks - Fixed, will release publically in due course (I know there will be
not be another emu release so I will not wait for one).

Older Emus - Fixed single and sound. Multi cannot be improved since those
emus do not load by CRC. Will release publically when the archive contains
some more changes.

Calice - Will do another time. Too tired right now!

All changes are Dats.tar.gz which is currently being uploaded to the team

the dats. As a consequence, I have fixed a few of the dats too:

Neo-Geo
Neo-Geo (sound)
Calice
Nebula
Nebula JukeBox
NeoJukeBox

None are so important that I will rush to release them but they are in the
latest Dats.tar.gz should you want them. All will be updated soon enough
anyway I'd imagine so it is just Calice that will need a forced release
(incidentally Ben Jos, you must have had an older version before I fixed
most of the conflict errors).

Neo-Geo needs neonopon updating and rotd adding too but I will not mention
rotd when it is added. The owners are threatening to sue anyone responsible
for emulating it so I don't want emu sites around the world qouting news
like 'Logiqx has added Rage of the Dragons to the Neo-Geo dat'. I am
staggered at how many news sites report simple dat updates so I will just
slip it in quitely when there are other things to list as updates. ;)

Yes, probably. The original code didn't write things to a log file. When I
added support for a log file, I forgot one or two places, and I added those
later, when I actually saw the error printed on the screen, but it didn't
appear in the log file. There actually still may be a few places in the code
where it prints things on the screen, but doesn't put it in the log file.
I'll
have to go over the code again soon.

I noticed there are a few "neosndrom" lines in the Calice dat file. Does
that
mean they are not used by Calice? Because CMP will skip them. And if they
are
not used by Calice, is there any specific reason that those lines are in
there
as opposed to not being in there at all?

On a different note: Mike, I think you meant "complement" everywhere where
you
use "compliment", unless you really meant to praise all those ROMs. :-)

It's just my way of keeping track of ROMs that belong to a game but not used
by the emulator. I find it is easiest to do it this way so that if/when the
emulator adds sound you can just do a search and replace rather than try
adding the newly required ROMs to every game. ;)

Done many changes to the dats recently (to fix things shown by ValiDat) so I
decided to release them all tonight.

Latest TARs are currently being uploaded to the team areas too. Three dats
are outstanding:

- CottAGE v0.10
- YAAME v0.3
- M1 v0.7 (700 games!)

We may have to split up M1 and do it as a group or then again it may be
possible to script it. I haven't looked at the new M1 yet and haven't got
time to do so tonight. I have a new 80GB hard drive to install (ready for
the next MAME release, lol) and will be going out after that is done.

I asked him whether he knew if the one floating around (i.e. the one you and
I
have) is incorrect or simply contains the tracks in a different order or
something. Here's his reply:

"Im not sure, it could be the same image but simply ripped in a different
format."

I've also sent an e-mail to submit@mame.net about the MAME 0.61 clones with
ROMs that can be merged with their parents. I had hoped that someone like
you,
Mike, who is well-known in the emulator scene would add a bit more weight to
submissions, but apparently not, since it took them so long to include your
sample fix. Or maybe they did, and it will take even longer before they
listen
to mere mortals like me. :-)  Although... in a deep dark past, I submitted
twice to MAME; one fix was incorporated in the very next version, the other
took 5 or 6 versions.

In this dat file, I noticed that badlands has two identical ROMs listed: a13
and c13. In 0.99.4, this ROM used to be called c13, but it was renamed to
a13
in 0.99.5. I checked the source code of Daphne to make sure it ONLY requires
a13 now and not c13. So the c13 line should be removed from the dat.

I was also going to make a remark about the readme*.txt files in dle, dle20,
and sae. It seemed to me that those could be removed from the dat. But when
I
was going through Daphne's source code, I noticed that these HAVE to be
there
and have to be unmodified. Otherwise, Daphne won't play these games (at
least
not unless you compile your own version). Ah well, I put them back into my
ROMs for now...

So forget my remark about these text files. :-)

Finally, when going through the source code, I noticed that there are
several
more games that Daphne supports. Based on the information in the source
code,
I made a dat containing the ROMs for Bega's Battle (revisions 1 and 3), GP
World, and Interstellar. I've attached a zip file containing this dat. Maybe
we should add it to the Daphne dat?

They were posted to alt.binaries.emulators.mame earlier today...

If anything else fails, I can give you access to my FTP site, but the three
CHDs total 2.16 gigs, and since I'm capped upstream, you wouldn't get it
faster than at 37 k/s or so. So it would take quite a while. About 17 hours
at
the very least, if I calculated it correctly.

Another possibility is that it is a different release (bug fix or

I must admit that my sample fix was created about one month after I appeared
on the scene though. ;)

Other fixes have been in the next version iirc.

They are disabled in the build. If you look at the latest
Dats/Recent/Multi/Daphne directory you'll see a comparison script that spots
games added and rmoved each version. The extra games are currently disabled
and can't be run (at the moment). However, I think that I will download the
ROms into a 'Needed Soon/Daphne' directory. ;)

Sorry, my mistake. Bega's Battle is in there too (I must have missed it when
it was added some time previously). That kind of slip shouldn't happen again
now that I am using the DaphneLoaderInfo.ini files to spot new games.

I will release an updated dat later tonight (hopefully). I still haven't
installed my new hard drive... didn't get time last night and I have 400MB
of needed soon ROMs on my work laptop to copy onto my home machine. ;)

My pleasure. I've enjoyed the Logiqx dats for a long time. Every time some
emulator had gotten updated, I started checking Mike's site several times a
day for the updated dats. Now I can actually do something to make that time
shorter. :-)  Although I think I have created more work for Mike recently by

I left it in intentionally. Past experience has shown me that taking out
unused ROMs from games first being emulated just causes people to delete
their ROMs and then have to re-download once the ROM is used (not to mention
the need for dat changes). It appears to be a program ROM for sound, so in
my view it is likely to be used at some time.

OK. Makes sense. Although I think you were replying to my remark regarding

Yes, it definitely looks like it. I quickly whipped up a program that
calculates the old MAME checksum, the CRC32, and the MD5 of a given file.
I'll
have a look at all the CRCs in this dat now.

OK... first off, I don't have ROMs with names (never mind CRCs) like the
ones
I'm missing from dumpmtmt, charon, rhero, abcop, ab1, and spidrman (Leslaw
gave the list earlier), so I can't say anything about those.

Then:
[Set: pitfall.   ROMs written: 0.   Bytes written: 0.]
* ERROR  : NOT FOUND: [name 6462] [size 8192] [crc 2a17492d]

I found a pitfall2 ROM with a name that had 6462 in it, renamed it to 6462,
but neither the CRC nor the checksum matches:
 rom ( name 6462 size 8192 crc 86bb9185 checksum 0ecd1add md5
eddb9d3e05b346af53452993a3ac40b1 )

[Set: thunderb.   ROMs written: 3.   Bytes written: 229,918.]
* ERROR  : NOT FOUND: [name epr11319.bin] [size 131072] [crc 4a053070]

No match here either with what I have:
 rom ( name 11319.epr size 131072 crc 50d9242e checksum c3bc6af2 md5
e967ce824f9de2f8fb0f8558e91471eb )

[Set: strider.   ROMs written: 0.   Bytes written: 0.]
* ERROR  : NOT FOUND: [name strider.09] [size 65536] [crc 85adabcd]
* ERROR  : NOT FOUND: [name strider.18] [size 131072] [crc 6e80d9f2]
* ERROR  : NOT FOUND: [name strider.19] [size 131072] [crc c906d49a]

As Leslaw had already discovered, these use the old MAME checksum instead of
the CRC:
 rom ( name strider.09 size 65536 crc 2ed403bc checksum 85adabcd md5
da67b837a0a1dbd716a9c6f74c34d02c )
 rom ( name strider.18 size 131072 crc 4386bc80 checksum 6e80d9f2 md5
4b70e4bee8414d6e0c55345b554ab6c8 )
 rom ( name strider.19 size 131072 crc 444536d7 checksum c906d49a md5
94d2e6720108cf80aa5361bf2711d17c )

So at the very least, in this dat file, the entries for strider need to have
the CRC corrected.

Currently the dat file is just the listinfo output from the emulator itself
(but with dup ROMs removed). Seeing as people are keen to update it we may
as well do a few things as well as CRCs; the description are a bit rubbish
(caps), as are the manufacturers and the years are missing too. Whilst
fixing the dat, these can be corrected but leave the '[sound only]' comments
that I added as they are for the benefit of CAESAR.

I will assist Ben Jos with finding the ROMs that he is missing (as much as I
can) and he can then work on getting this dat improved. :)

I helped a bit Onyx in finding some old files for making his
rollbacks (not finished so I guess no one of you have heard of
them). As a result, I have around 600mb of non-mame roms, as old
as MAME 0.34 and Callus 0.2, and certainly very possible that
files you might want to complete certain old collections be here,
like with that MMSnd.

So if you give me a CMPro or RomCenter dat with the crc's you
want, I'll search in my archives, I'm sure I have many of them
already in my HD.

OK. I just started on cleaning up this dat. When I noticed there were ROMs
that were identical between some sets, I wondered if this
emulator supported merging. I found out it's based on MAME, so I suppose it
does, but I'll make sure by actually testing it. While I
was searching for this emulator, I found a much more recent version, 0.60,
at  http://shica.cool.ne.jp/mmsnd/. I guess we should
forget about 0.36b10 then and do 0.60 instead? (Or both? Or ignore 0.60?)
Ironically, strider (the set that prompted this whole
thing) is not in 0.60. :-)

As for the years, descriptions, and manufacturers, I use those from the
latest MAME dat as much as possible. What about the things
like "(World)", "(Japan)", etc.? Should I leave those in as well? So make
it:
    description "Darius [sound only]"
or
    description "Darius (World) [sound only]"

Thanks. I've attached an MMSnd dat in which I have kept only the things I
don't have.

In the ab1 set, I noticed a strange size for ab_pcm.dat: 393216. But then I
realised that 393216=3*131072, so I thought it was a concatenation of three
128k files. Looking at the MAME source code, I did indeed find 3 128k ROMs
for the sound in After Burner. Unfortunately, though, none of the 6
different
ways of concatenating those 3 files yielded the desired CRC. Ah well...

How much has changed game wise? If v0.60 is genuinely a newer version (and
not someone elses replacement) then it makes sense to ditch v0.36b10 and
move to v0.60 (both for the dat and CAESAR).

>     description "Darius (World) [sound only]"

If the sound is the same across all variants then I don't see any reason to
keep the region in the title.

Try byte swapping them too. If it were a matter of turning two ROMs into one
I'd also suggest trying interleaving too but since there are three files,
byte swapping is the only thing applicable.

Well, for games that were already in 36b10 and that have not been removed in
60, they still have the capitalisation thing and the missing years. For
newer
games, there are years and better descriptions. If I were to guess, then I'd
say someone (maybe even the original author) took 36b10 and updated it for
MAME 0.60.

I've attached the log from mamediff -v "MMSnd v0.36b10.dat" "MMSnd
v0.60.dat".

Hmmm, there are a fair few things removed. I wonder how many are non-MAME
games? Attached is the CAESAR map file that maps games in MMSnd to MAME
games (m) or non-MAME games (n). This should help you check for me. :)

If not too many games removed are non-MAME then it makes sense to update
CAESAR without a second thought. If many of the removals are non-MAME games
then we may want to track down who released it and possibly regard it as a
different emulator (i.e. keep the original in CAESAR and add the new one in
addition, same goes for the dats).

But you haven't noticed another odd size in Racing Hero :-p
Datutil rulez!!!!!

Ok I have 9gb of arcade roms in my HD, plus 500mb of old roms not
used anymore, and I've not found any roms from the dat you
sent... I would have at least expected some from games I actually
have (since I never got AB Cop, Charon or Dump Matsumoto). I
should have some old ones from Pitfall2, Spiderman and such, but
bad luck man...

I have a question I already asked to Logiqx, but he was
distracted and didn't answer. It's not trivia, I really want to
know the answer. Which MAME version was the first to have
-listinfo output?

Good suggestion. Didn't yield the desired CRC either, though. :-(

At some point a while ago, while trying to find missing ROMs, I was thinking
of writing a program that is a bit similar to your rombuild. Basically, it
would take a ROM and calculate a bunch of CRCs for it. One for the original
ROM, one of the first half of it, one for the second half, one for the ROM
concatenated to itself, one byte-swapped, etc., and then maybe also have it
be able to do some of the tricks you do in rombuild for creating one ROM out
of two. I never got around to it, though.

Of the non-MAME games, the following two are the only ones from 36b10 that
are not in 60:

game (
  name psyforce
  description "Psychic Force [sound only]"
  manufacturer "TAITO"
  rom ( name e22-07 size 131072 crc 739af589 )
  rom ( name e22-01 size 2097152 crc 808b8340 )
)

game (
  name thndcept
  description "Thunder Cepter [sound only]"
  manufacturer "NAMCO"
  rom ( name tc1-21.bin size 32768 crc 3b942f5f )
  rom ( name tc1-22.bin size 32768 crc cfef5481 )
)

However, 60 does contain something that seems to be thndcept:

game (
  name hangon
  description "Hang On"
  year 1985
  manufacturer "SEGA"
  rom ( name 6831.rom size 32768 crc cfef5481 )
  rom ( name 6832.rom size 32768 crc 4165aea5 )
  rom ( name 6833.rom size 16384 crc 3b942f5f )
)

So it looks like ONLY psyforce is gone as far as non-MAME games go.

34b8 was the first. It was quite a pain when I made dats for 30 final, 31
final, and 33 final. No CRCs and no -listinfo. I basically did a -listroms
for every single game and captured all the output and converted it to dat
format. The conversion from checksum to CRC was just as painful, but I'll
spare you the details of how exactly I did it.

Well now I would really want to know in simple words how could you do that!
As
far as I know, checksums are sums, additions, where as CRC's are divisions -
long
divisions in binary and with no carry. So how could you transform one and
the
other?

For the curious, a CRC is just a long division. You divide the message data
by
the CRC polynomial (a seed), using binary division with no carry. Actually
to do
such a long division you only need to apply XOR, shift, XOR, shift, until
there's
no message left (xor is binary division with no carry, and the shift goes
thru
all the data). The final remainder IS the CRC (well you need to apply a
little
touch). So it's a division transformed into XOR & Shifting, but moreover,
you can
simplify it even more because you can use certain tables to get the results
of
that XOR and shifting much faster and at bigger steps. That's called a
table-driven implementation. Almost all CRC32 implementations (zip style
CRC),
are just a 32 bit constant (the CRC polynomial), a table with some 32 bit
values,
and an one-line loop. These implementations are as fast as 2.5mb per second
in
my P2-333 (with my own code). So you can imagine in one of those
P4@2.53ghz...
Anyway when you look at them you can't imagine that after all, it's just a
hack
to find the remainder of a very long division, something that an 8-year old
kid
can do. There's really no black magic in CRC's.

But now, I'm very curious about how is calculated that old MAME checksum. Do
they
just sum up 4 byte groups and then leave the modulus?

Well, I usually use the word "checksum" in a broader sense. I'd still call
it
a checksum even if it does not include additions. I actually would call a
CRC
a checksum as well. To me, a checksum is just a global name for a number
used
to validate data. So then a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is one specific
kind of checksum. MD5 is another kind of checksum. SHx are others, etc.

> So how could you transform one and the
> other?

I didn't literally transform one into the other. There is no magical
function
f such that f(mamechecksum) = crc. What I did was calculate the CRC for
every
ROM that had the correct checksum. I wrote a program that went through all
the MAME ROMs, calculated the checksum, and whenever the checksum matched
one
in my dat, I calculated its CRC and added that CRC to the rom line in the
dat. So what I ended up with, basically, was a big lookup table translating
checksums into CRCs. As long as the sets where I got my information from
matched the ones in my dat, I could be fairly sure that it was correct that
way.

> But now, I'm very curious about how is calculated that old MAME checksum.

> just sum up 4 byte groups and then leave the modulus?

It's mostly just a sum, yes. They take 2-byte groups (16 bits) and sum them.
The only twist is that, at the same time, they also have another variable
that they XOR with each of those 16-bit words. Both variables start at 0.
When they're finished doing that for the entire message, they take that sum
modulus 16 bits (65536) (so the low order 16 bits), shift it left 16 times
(so it becomes the high order 16 bits of a 32 bits number), and they add the
low order 16 bits of that xor variable to it. It's a lot shorter to explain
it in C. :-)

For those who can read C, the entire thing looks something like this:

BYTE *buf;
WORD word;
DWORD i,checksum,xor,ROMsize;

for (i = checksum = xor = 0; i < ROMsize; i += 2)
{ word = (((WORD)buf[i]) << 8) + buf[i+1];
  checksum += word;
  xor ^= word;
}
checksum = ((checksum & 0xffff) << 16) | (xor & 0xffff);

Note that they use Big-Endian words...

So it's not a very good way of checking validity. It's not much more than a
16-bit sum over 16-bit words, although the "running XOR" does make it a bit
less likely that two different ROMs yield the same checksum. Still, a simple
32-bit CRC is a lot better. But with the number of ROMs in MAME these days,
a
32-bit CRC is really not good enough anymore either.

Some of them were really hard to find!.
Anyway - I gave up 34 mame since it uses checksums - a listinfo
missing is not a problem (I have made a program which produce like
listinfo file). Crc32 was a problem - All roms you have to find
yourself.

WELL - all my old roms are on CD's, I have made a dat from each
directory (each directory was named the web I get it from).
And I have all the dats, so I usually run rominfo to find a crc.
But I could not do it in this case - these are checksums I am pretty
sure.
I will need a BenJos program (Hi BenJos that one which produced you
all crc of roms you have sorted).
I will need a program who will spot the different roms I have using my
dats.
(I never bother to wrote one since rominfo did a trick).
I will try to help you somehow.

Wish me luck.

But how many are duplicates? :-P

I got fed up myself with having duplicates everywhere, so I wrote several
programs that help me manage everything and keep the number of duplicates to
a minimum. And then I have my database which contains everything in raw
compressed format, without ANY duplicates. I can build everything I have
from
that. Almost 50,000 distinct ROMs, about 12 GB. So now, whenever I download
ROMs, I run one of my programs on them first to see which ones I already
have.

> I will need a BenJos program (Hi BenJos that one which produced you

I used a great little program called szf for that. I bet Mike knows it. ;-)
It comes with the source code and I just modified it slightly to give me the
output I wanted. You should be able to easily find it if you do a search for
szf100.zip. If not, let me know and I'll send you a copy. And if you're
running Windows NT/2000/XP, you can use the SORT.EXE command line program
that comes with it to sort that text file. The one in 9x/Me is limited to
64k
files, which makes it pretty useless.

In that case, you can use the sort.exe that's in the cygwin\bin directory:

I have around 5gb of old roms, not counting sets actually in Logiqx's
datafiles.
But after copying, I did a quick run of ZipIdent and fdaz to get rid of
those
thousand dupes.... I bet that from those 9gb, only 300 or 400 megs are
actually
roms (not games, just roms) not supported by MAME.

But now I know who has the missing roms we need for the rollbacks!

> I used a great little program called szf for that. I bet Mike knows it.
;-)

 http://home.online.no/~tjaberg :-p Not like it's top secret.

Actually what I do is run ZipIdent and then fdaz. I can concatenate as much
dats
for zipident as I want, so I'm sure that I'm not letting dupes or roms
already
supported in my sooners/unemulated.

Actually between ZipIdent 1.1 or MAME 0.63, I have my doubts....

Well, I thought of it yesterday actually. With some of the new games (Area

"MAME: Emulating games of the past on hardware of the future." or maybe
"MAME: Emulating yesterday's games on tomorrow's hardware".

Anyway, it made me chuckle. :)

Responder a: teamlogiqx@emuverse.com

While searching for the dumpmtmt ROMs that are listed in MMSnd, I made a
shocking (well, shocking for me, at least) discovery: I downloaded a zipfile
that had some of the ROMs compressed even smaller than I have mine
compressed. I am obsessed with Roman's ZipMax program and I thought that the
total of 40 different settings for 9 different zip programs I use was pretty
much optimal. But some program somewhere obviously can zip things smaller
than I have been able to so far. (Or else, a program I am using, but with
different parameters. That seems pretty unlikely, though, because I think I
tried pretty much everything.)
Aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! :-)

So here is my small request to you all: From the bodyslam/dumpmtmt set, take
the file 7721.bin (size 32,768, CRC 62a9143e) and see how small you can get
it by zipping it. Remember that, sometimes, a program will zip a file
smaller
using "normal compression" than when using "maximum compression". It's rare,
but it happens. The best settings usually yield the best results, but not
always. And sometimes WinZip yields better compression than PKZIP, while
other times, it's the other way around. So try as many different programs
and
settings as possible. Oh, and the result must be a PKZIP 2.0 compatible
zipfile. In other words, MAME must be able to read it. This leaves out the
relatively new "Deflate64" method used in PKZip 4.0 and up.

What I am interested in is the smallest compressed size you can get for this
file and how you did it (i.e. which program and which settings). I want to
know the compressed size, not the size of the zipfile. When opening a
zipfile
with WinZip, the "Packed" column will show the compressed size. For this
7721.bin file, using WinZip 8.1 with "Maximum (slowest) compresssion", the
packed size will be 16,265.

So if you have a few minutes to spare at some point...

Thanks!
Ben Jos (who knows his request sounds crazy).

For those that are wondering how HDDs will appear in MAME, it's like this:

game (
 name area51
 description "Area 51"
 year 1995
 manufacturer "Atari Games"
 rom ( name 3h size 524288 crc 116d37e6 region user1 flags 0x16 offs 0 )
 rom ( name 3p size 524288 crc eb10f539 region user1 flags 0x16 offs 1 )
 rom ( name 3m size 524288 crc c6d8322b region user1 flags 0x16 offs 2 )
 rom ( name 3k size 524288 crc 729eb1b7 region user1 flags 0x16 offs 3 )
 disk ( name area51.chd md5 130b330eff59403f8fc3433ff501852b region disks
index 0 )
 chip ( type cpu name 68EC020 clock 25000000 )
 chip ( type cpu name Jaguar_GPU clock 26000000 )
 chip ( type cpu flags audio name Jaguar_DSP clock 26000000 )
 chip ( type audio name DAC )
 chip ( type audio name DAC )
 video ( screen raster orientation horizontal x 320 y 240 aspectx 4 aspecty
3 freq 60.000000 )
 sound ( channels 2 )
 input ( players 3 control lightgun buttons 1 coins 4 )
 dipswitch ( name "Service Mode" )
 driver ( status good color good sound good palettesize 65534 )
)

Until I get around to finishing the rewrite of DatUtil (that has been on
hold since March), adding them into the MAME dats will be a manual task.
However, for just 3 HDDs I can live with doing it manually. ;)

Damn. That sucks. When I went through this dat file, I knew I should have
downloaded the 0.99.5a source code instead of comparing things to the 0.99.5
source code I already had.

Anyway, I downloaded the source code and went through each and every game it
has in it (including the ones that are not activated). I can confirm that,
yes, dle was renamed to dle11 and that badlands.c4 was added. Apart from the
unneeded an06 in Bega's Battle and the badlands.c13 line that should be
removed (things we already knew about), this is all that has changed. While
I
was at it, I added entries for every single game that appears in the Daphne
source code. As for the games that are not in the list of 22 in the Daphne
.ini file, I gave them a "unusedgame" instead of "game" entry. And for the
extra ROMs not appearing in the source code (such as that an06 ROM), I used
"unusedrom" lines. So if you want, we can easily take out these "unused"
entries and release it as such, while we keep the "full" version internally.

I have attached the resulting dat file. I did not check it by running
Daphne,
though, but I'm pretty certain it is correct now.

I have also cleaned up the MMSnd v0.36b10 dat file and corrected it as best
I
could, and I have created a dat for MMSnd v0.60. Since I couldn't find any
of
the ROMs listed before, I cannot guarantee those entries in the dat file. If
anyone is interested in these MMSnd dat files, let me know where to
send/upload them.

Interesting... no CRCs for CHDs?

And is this the actual correct MD5 for Area 51? If so, do you also have the
correct MD5s for the other two? I'd better start checking mine.

I have attached a slightly updated one. Forget the one I just sent. I added
some merge information to some unused ROMs for firefoxa. Of course, this
assumes that (1) Daphne will some day use those ROMs, and (2) when it does,
they will be merged with firefox. Seeing how they have merged everything
else
so far, I think that the second one is a pretty safe assumption. But, of
course, they may never add these unused ROMs and simply run the games
without
them...
