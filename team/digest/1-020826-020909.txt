Hi,

Thank you for getting in touch with Pi and for your patience with me. This
last week I have been waiting on ztnet to set up a mailing list so that we
can communicate but now given up on them (for the time being at least) and
asked a friend to create one for us instead; Dave Ewing from Emuverse. You
should receive an e-mail shortly from the Emuverse server so please follow
it's instructions and you will be on the team mailing list. Dave also will
be on the list for a few days but will then disappear once he is happy it is
working okay.

Once on the list, you can mail teamlogiqx@emuverse.com to send a mail to the
full team. Once subscribed, can you please let Pi know and then either he or
I can declare the list active when everyone is in attendance (I'd hate
anyone to miss the initial conversations). Once everyone is on the list, we
can all introduce ourselves and then I'll let you know how I see the best
way to proceed with things. From your mails to Pi, I think I can see what
you will each be able to contribute but simply expressing a wish to help has
allowed a couple of inexperienced people onto the list (maybe as a quiet
guests to begin with, but learning more as time goes on).

Hopefully we'll be able to make a start on things soon but please bear with
me a little. My current project at work keeps me away from home five days a
week and e-mail access is very limited (no mornings or evenings, just the
few minutes that I can grab during the day without being noticed by the
client!). Weekends are just as busy too since I have other hobbies to enjoy
and a girlfriend to spend time with.

I'm sure we'll be able to make a success of Team Logiqx and will happily
impart as much of my knowledge as possible (I am sure that you will also
learn from each other too). Welcome to the list, once you've subscribed that
is! :)

Mike (aka Logiqx)

Hi

I feel this is needed:

Up to now, six members have signed the list: Logiqx himself, of
course, and me, what would you do without me :) And:
LostClown
Dr. Zer0
Shadowpri
HaDBeEN

We are waiting four more:
Rosewood
RealPosix
Odeon
Metroid

Those are the nicks, I have written down around here who prefers
to be called by name in the list and who prefers nick, but well
that will be clear when everyone does his own introduction. But
that will not happen until everyone has joined the list. This is
a remainder that you should not send messages to the list until
Logiqx states that the list is complete. Be patient.

(If you are reading this and you are in the "waiting list", you
have to tell me that you've joined so we know when to say the
list is complete!)

Sorry guys, no girls in the list for now ;)

regards, Pi

Hi everyone,

I don't think that everyone has subscribed yet but as I'm keen to get you
all started I think it's time to declare this list open. :)

So that we all have an idea of who we are, let's introduce ourselves with a
short e-mail. Just simple things like age, occupation, hobbies, location,
time zone etc. All information should be regarded as confidential and only
for the eyes of people on this list. I'll start!

I'm 30 years old and work in computers (surprise eh?), creating business
intelligence solutions. My job title is technical consultant but in simple
terms I do everything from the the initial design of systems, through to the
development and implementation. As well as having arcade emulation as a
hobby I am a keen windsurfer and also do Salsa (great way to pick up chicks
btw!). I live in the county of Hertfordshire (UK), which is about 30 minutes
north of London. My time zone is obviously GMT in the winter and GMT+1 in
the summer.

I have prepared a couple of things for you all so I'll write a mail to
explain them in a few minutes.

Asunto: [TeamLogiqx] Batch scripts for uploading to logiqx.com

De: "Logiqx" <logiqx@logiqx.com>
Responder a: teamlogiqx@emuverse.com

The plan is to have one person responsible for uploading stuff to the site
but I would like as many people as possible to know how it is done (for
holiday cover, rest breaks etc). If several people know how it works then it
also makes explaining it to new people easier when it becomes necessary (as
it is not reliant on just me).

In order to upload stuff to the site, I propose that we use the same system
that I have been using for CAESAR. The idea is that we only want to upload
files that are new or have changed and the easiest way to do this is with a
couple of simple batch scripts. I won't go into too much detail as to why I
do this when there are so many site upload tools (one of which I like very
much and use regularly) but they really hate such a huge website as CAESAR.
:)

Okay, here are the scripts I prepared for you all:

http://www.logiqx.com/Team/scripts.zip

Drop them into the directory that you extracted logiqx_www.zip into. Only
two of the scripts are really important to you but the other two are handy
while you are playing/learning:

xcopy_to_upload_dir.bat
-----------------------

Copies all new or updated files into c:\upload\logiqx.www
Once files have been copied to c:\upload\logiqx.www they will not be copied
again unless they change.

It will also copy the tar_all_for_upload.bat script into
c:\upload\logiqx.www (from where it should be run).

c:\upload\logiqx.www\tar_all_for_upload.bat (put there by the xcopy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Creates a single file for upload.

I will explain how to upload this file in a separate e-mail (basically just
an FTP upload and a CGI call - using the URL that I provide).

If you have not got Cygwin installed then you will need a couple of Unix
commands. I have put them here so just extract them to a directory somewhere
in your path (c:\windows\command for example):

http://www.logiqx.com/Team/targz.zip

archive_bit_clear.bar archive_bit_set.bat
-----------------------------------------

The xcopy script utilises the archive bit. For those that don't know, the
archive bit of each file gets 'set' every time the file is saved. My xcopy
script copies files that have the archive bit set then clears it
automatically (so that the file doesn't get processed again the next time
the xcopy is run).

You won't need to use the 'set' script very often but the 'clear' script
will be useful to avoid uploading stuff that you don't wish to (i.e. run it
before you start making changes to a something).

Tips
----

All scripts prompt you before they do their job. If you run the wrong script
by accident then just close the command window (the 'x' at the top tight of
the window) and the action will not take place.

Please let me know when you have got the hang of these scripts. If someone
has problems then helping them out will ensure that your understanding is as
good as you think it is. :)

To get things started, I think the first thing is to work out what needs
updating. Many of the resources (snaps, flyers, marquees, artwork etc) have
been updated and I also created dats for the last MAME release (within one
of the ZIPs that you all downloaded). I updated the 'Older Emus' to
correspond to the last MAME release too.

If we can put together a list of what needs uploading to logiqx.com, then we
can use those dats to practice the procedure of issuing new XML+ZIPs for
upload. All of the dats mentioned have been created already so it makes
sense to get them online first.

Once we are all up to date with that, we can start on updating the dats that
need it (Kawaks, Nebula, FBA, Laser, Calice, Cottage spring to mind). When
we start on these I will offer advice to make life easier but I don't want
to flood the list with too much information at this time. ;)

Would someone like to volunteer for maintaining the list of what needs
uploading first? Everyone can help investigate what is out of date but until
we're on top of it all I think it will make things much simpler if one
person keeps track of our progress.

Define "short". Well it all started on a stormy night on October 1972.....

I don't think I need introduction since you all contacted me (in some cases
before Logiqx himself). I'm Pi. Not that I want to keep my name secret (Juan
Miguel anyway, but not-tell-it) but everyone calls me Pi, except my family.
I'm
29, from Spain, single, blah blah blah. I worked as programmer some eons
ago,
currently unemployed. Besides emulation, I like movies and books, I NEED
heavy
doses of music every day (Mike Oldfield and Jean Michel Jarre are my favs),
and
optionally I play games like The Sims, GTA, and oldies/abandonware.

I'm an obsessive compulsive collector of everything. I have a big collection
of
Chloe Jones (2000 pics), a big collection of song lyrics(50,000 i think), a
huge
collection of mods/s3m (18,000), and now I'm starting with movie scripts
(only
200 for now). Just as an example.

Other than that I'm a lazy, boring, bored guy.

Btw Logiqx, I will maintain the list of what emus need to be updated. Also I
know which ones have been updated and when :) I'll post the list once I
finish
doing it. Not tonight, not tomorrow. Dentist appoinment, I don't think I
will
have humour after it :-p

...pass the year 1979 and in a night of april I was born...

And after 23 years I'm writing this Electronic-Mail (miracle of science).

Hello to everyone (again), my real name is: Scianna Andrea, but please don't
use that name outside this wall, please !
As you see, I chose "Dr.Zer0" as my Net-Name, of course I like
old-robot-cartoon, etc (like F....man).

I'm came from Italy (GMT +1), and I NOT(hate) computer, NOT(hate) film, and
I NOT(hate) music, I know emulation community since MAME v0.33 (I count the
time with the MAME version), but this is the first time that I'm doing
something in emulation comunity, hope this is start of more long
"contribute" in this beautiful world of emulation.........................
:-). Ok Ok I like science fiction (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.), and my dream
is to see every system emulated one day.

I'm study at University, and I'm just learn Turbo Pascel, and now I'm start
learnig ANSI C. For real I'm alredy do same DAT for personal use, and I
share this with Logiqx and Feysoft (?), but I consider that DAT like an
exception of  the rule.

For now I think this is enough, end excuse me for my bad English, hope you
can understand.

Hello all.

Nice to witness this list come alive :)

I'm 33 years old and live in Iceland.  For the last 5 years I have mostly
been working as a programmer.  Before that time I was studying Computer
Science at The Unuversity of Iceland.  Started working before I completed
my B.S. degree.  And finally now I am planning to finish it this winter
while working only half time (if this isn't luxury :)

The timezone in Iceland is GMT all year round.  This is like us having
summertime all year round, which I think is fine.  Currently I am working
at The National and University Library of Iceland on projects that handle
digitization of old material and digital preservation of the same material
and also new material that only exists digitally.

I have more hobbies than I have time to tackle.  Have been singing in a
choir for a few years and like it a lot.  Keeps me from working overtime
two nights a week :)  Also I like traveling and caving.  Have a tendency
for collecting.  Don't know if it is obsessive as with PI :)  And then
I like music alot.  And it seems I have some things in common with Pi
as Mike Oldfield and Jean Michelle Jarre are two of my many favorites.

Then I like reading books.  And rather than writing my own books I often
like to write programs in my spare time.  I have never bothered carrying
a camera until recently when I bought a digital one which might become
a new hobby.

Computer games are always a good way to relax.  My first experince with them
was playing MsPacman.  And my first computer, a Sinclair Spectrum 48K was
a great playground.  My first experience of emulation was actually
downloading a Spectrum emulator.

If you think this introduction is getting a bit long then I can also tell
you that once in a while I dive into the field of genealogy or read
philosophy so I can whole hartedly tell you that this has been a short
introduction :)

It seems as I have forgotten to mention my name! which is Haukur Kristofer
Bragason.  I ask you to please keep my real name away from the world
outside this list.  LostClown is my official nick :)

I have downloaded the two zips previously mention on the list, but will
probably be to busy to look seriously into them for the next few days.

Best regards,
LostClown

automated), and as the past and present maintainer of the MAME artwork and
samples datfiles.  I'm a 33 year old Canadian, currently struggling my way
through a degree in Computer Engineering.  I have been a devotee of MAME and
emulation for about 3 years and believe that the hundreds (thousands?) of
hours of fun I have drawn from the efforts of so many brilliant and inspired
people should be repaid with whatever of my efforts I can provide.

Then that makes 3 of us. :)

> Computer games are always a good way to relax.

I have loved video and computer games since I gazed upon my first Pong
machine during a family trip to the US in 1974.  Even at the tender age of
5, I knew that this was a watershed moment in history.

I'm new to the list, so I only have a link to logiqx_dats.zip - could
someone please send a link to the other file?  Thank you.  I have yet to
play around with Roman's Dir2Dat functionality.  Any comments about this vs.
DatUtil?

I look forward to knowing and working with you all.  My programming skills
are not yet developed, but I am keen to learn.  So who else is involved,
aside from Haukur, Mike, Pi (what IS your name?) and myself?

Talk to you soon,
Rob

Hey everyone !
My name is Pavel.I don't think somebody from this list know me,I was never
involved in
any emulation activity.I'm 17 year old from Israel .
My hobbies are emulation,computer games,chess,tennis,a little ping pong here
and there.
Favorite retro game is Space Invaders,cause it's the ONLY arcade game i'm
good in.
I don't use Mame as much as i want to,more standalone emulators like
Kawaks,Gens,Pj64,Zsnes.
Mostly console emus and new arcade .
Cps2 is the only system i *try* to collect all roms for...i'm bad collector
:)
I have some basic knowledge of C and some windows Api programming,and good
knowledge of some Web related things,Html,Javascript,VBscript,PHP,Mysql.I'm
working part time in small web developing company as programmer.
What else ?
I hope i will learn something from the project and contribute something to
it.
Best wishes to all people in the team :)
Ah,almost forgot,my nick is Shadowpri.Sorry for bad english.

Hi everyone, again.

Apologies for being late. I've been the last 2 days without
phone, I'm on dial up so basically I couldn't do anything. Not
even able to connect from a friend's puter to say "I'm off" due
to some bad coincidences.

Well I've placed a list of emus at
http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/emulist4dat.xls (16kb). If
anyone can't read Excel files (you can import them in Word for
example) don't worry as I'll htmlize it later. It contains the
emus, where to download them (for the ones with weak bookmarks),
the current version, and the last dat made by Logiqx for that
emu.

For Mike, there is a list of emus which I consider might be added
to the "older emus" package cause they are old. Covered with
spiderwebs and dust. Old. I'd call the package "emu geriatric"
but I guess Mike will not like it :)

Also there is a list of when the last system dats were updated,
but I guess no one will want to touch those until familiar with
the rest of the dat making. That's all in the excel file.

For some more dats, head to
http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/dats.html or
http://www.clrmame.com and finally the FBA dats are at
http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/dats/fba_dats.zip (70kb) and
were done and sent by TrebleWinner (one of the FBA team).

Probably later I will receive some notes from Logiqx so the list
will be updated again. I'll then htmlize it and post again for
every update at a fixed URL.

For Mike: I've received a note from Phil, he sent the
authorization, but he is not in the list. Maybe the others also
signed in but it didn't work. Could you please resend the
invitations to join the list?

For Rob: Good to have here someone with good taste in music and
in news posters :) One of these days I will want to brag about it
and show you one of my fan emails (Mike saw it already).
Curiosity killed the cat, but since you're not a cat, my real
(and private) name is Juan Miguel. No one calls me Juan except my
family. My friends and the rest of the world know me as Pi.

For the rest: GREAT!

(If you haven't noted it yet, I'm a MAMETesters member, since a
week or so. Forgot to mention it in my introduction. Being a
MAMETesters is something great to have in your curriculum vitae.)

Okay, I'm finally back home but it's late and I'm tired so I haven't time to
read this fully tonight.

However, please don't start any emulator dats until I give tips as to the
best way to do them. Each one has useful tricks to save time and ensure
accuracy so I don't want anyone to waste their time (or mine in checking the
results).

What I really want first is for people to gather together the resource dats
that are already available, package them up, do the XML and release them.
This means that half of the task of releasing stuff is learnt before the
complication of creating dats as well. We'll start creating dats when the
resources are up on the website (people can say 'i want to do xxx' and I'll
give useful tips before they start).

Anyway, time for bed as I am shattered...

Mike

Updated http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/emulist.html

(another 1-minute htmlization)
Now I realize two things I've not mentioned:
* There is an updated CPS2 dat done by Raz only, at cps2shock.
* There are no links for the old emus, I'll fix them in the next
one-minute update of the list.

:-p

Q for Logiqx: What do we do with JAE? Cause JAE is at CAESAR,
right?

Did *everyone* read Logiqx's FAQs about dat making?????

Now I'm going to search the missing members of the list and then
prolly go out for some LOTR.

There is a dat (for CAESAR) but it never got released publically. I have a
feeling there were some funny things about it so I didn't want to release it
publically at that point. ;)

yeah, i have checked the dat - you have just changed the config of

I am pretty sure there is rom of starcas containing menu.e, menu.o
though.

I think we can try to find it in spare time ;).
I am sure some people have a vast colections of roms, (I still have

Great,
Here what i have done:
First i have put all my old CD's into hardrive, then using datutil i
have created dat for each CD!!!.
Then i have left on my HD only dats.

Then there is rominfo, It could find a desired crc in dats.

I have created dats for MAME:
version: 0.29,0.30,0.31,0.33,0.34final, break, 0.35b01 all till 0.61.
I have missing 0.34b01 and so on dats because mame don't have
-listinfo supported, dat for 0.30 and 0.31 was created by Ben-Jos and
checked by me and 0.29 i have created by myself.
i thought of creating a database of roms released (now, and in the
past) - this will be an easy way to recognize roms.
Anyone interested?

That's why i knew which roms have been changed.

So what we're going to do now?
Is there a list "what to do" or sth?

:-) (I'm search for i it "alot"), but at the end I realize that this ROMs in
a sort of memory dump related to "Speech Emulation", I think that the only
way to find out that ROMs is to contact the author directly.

I don't know if you alredy know this, but this is what I know !

We are waiting for Logiqx to have some little time to give us directions on
each
dat and how to use his "tools" on helping with the task. Well, the others. I
don't
do dats (just in case there is some confusion on that, I DON'T).

The to-do list is at http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/emulist.html
I've updated it today and added some eye-candy as a reward for the team :)

Btw welcome to the list/team :)

No. I spoke to the author and he made a mistake. He was trying to create a
Cinematronics multi system and was using the emulator to test it (the Star
Castle driver to be precise). He simply forgot to put the driver back to how
it should be before releasing an update to his emulator.

You won't find the Juno Boot ROMs because I know the Chris Hardy personally
(met in the flesh several times) and he is the only one with them. The other
Sideway ROMs are a mistake (I spoke to the author) and I suspect the astorm
problem was something Thierry did while experimenting (no real ROM for it
maybe).

Don't rely on just CRCs to compare ROMs... use ROMCMP and you'll gain an
understanding of why they have changed (byte swapping, overdumps,
underdumps, stuck bits, interleaving, etc). CRCs are good for catalogues but
bad for comparisons. ;)

>Is there a list "what to do" or sth?

First task is to get my site up to date with things like resource dats
(flyers, snaps, samples, artwork, marquees, etc). This means that people can
practice the business of packaging things up and updating the XML pages.
Once everyone can do this I'll start explaining how I update the various
dats with a view to people being able to do it themselves. I don't want to
say 'just do them' without exlpaining things as there is more to it than
just typing in what the updater thinks is right (and it almost always
avoiding use of DatUtil or CMPro to generate a dat). ;) When I get a chance
(hopefully later this week) I will go over MAME and CPS-2. Both of these
have hugely far reaching consequences for CAESAR and other emulators but
I'll explain it a bit at a time or the whole thing will overload everyone!

A few questions about dats:

First:
Mame 0.61 (very easy to do, "mame -listinfo > mame.txt" then Datutil
"datutil -f listinfo mame.txt"  and Mamediff (let say splitted roms)
"mamediff -S mame60.dat mame61.dat). (I have done it)
WinKawaks 1.45, it has built-in "clrmame" dat generation,
FinalBurn 2.9.3 also has built-in "clrmame" dat generation,
Nebula 2.19b has built-in Romcenter dat generation, use datutil
"datutil -f listinfo nebula_romcenter.dat", the author says the dat
genereration is fixed now, but Logiqx has put info in his dats that
this generation is not accurate, one has to check it - how? Some
script or so?

So anyway, i have all the dats above - no problems for them - i have
sent them to Mike (Logiqx) a week ago I can post it here.
The case is: Do we somehow validate the automatic genereated dats?
If yes how? By running each game one by one?

Best;

Patience young Padawan.

Then load into CMPro with error checking on and remove all duplicates that
are reported.

I won't go into the CAESAR stuff now as that is very involved (games in
other emulators need remapping to the new names when MAME uses, bad dumps
need identifying and fixing in old emus, ROMCmp support often needs creating
when MAME splits/joins/interleaves ROMs). All this is reported by stuff I
have written at the back of CAESAR. This won't be explained for months
though! Just keep in the back of your mind that such things do get done.

I updated all that lot on the day that the last MAME came out but never got
a chance to upload it.

>and Mamediff (let say splitted roms)
>"mamediff -S mame60.dat mame61.dat). (I have done it)

Yes, but it is done automatically with makefiles. Download the
'loqiqx_dats.zip' and you will see that everything is automated. Changing
the version number of MAME also regenerates the 'supplement' dats for all of
the emulators such as Nebula, Kawaks, RANIE , etc.

>WinKawaks 1.45, it has built-in "clrmame" dat generation,

We need the year and manufacturer in our dats (for CAESAR and CMPro report
window). However, Kawaks is good in that he is very thorough checking his
ROM details. In the first few releases of his emulator I helped him out a
bit and explained dat generation (how merging should be specified etc) but
since then he hasn't really made any mistakes.

The way to create the Kawaks dat is to do a MAMEDiff between the emulator
dat and the last Logiqx dat. Differences should be incorporated into the
Logiqx dat but I don't simply copy from the Kawaks dat. I copy the details
from another source (CPS-2 dat, MAME dat or something) and that way I spot
if he has made errors (I do a MAMEDiff between his dat and my dat). I report
errors to him and then alter my dat to be correct for the emulator.

The supplement dats are handled by the makefile. If the Kawaks dat or MAME
dat changes then the Kawaks supplements are re-generated automatically. I
load them into CMPro and scan my ROMs to determine if anything has changed.

>FinalBurn 2.9.3 also has built-in "clrmame" dat generation,

I don't think FB has year or manufacturer though. I added them to FBA but I
think the original still lacks them (apologies if 2.9.3 is FBA but I don't
know... I am not up to date at the moment). I use a very similar process to
the Kawaks dat updates when updating FB. For FBA I use their dat 100% and
the makefile generates the supplement dats.

Prior to my disappearance from public view, the dat generation in Nebula was
not using the driver information. It was simply a huge number of printf
statements in his code (basically)! He may have changed it to use the
drivers now but it will be simple to figure out if he has. In
logiqx_dats.zip, inside Dats/Recent/Multi/Nebula you will find a cmoparison
script that I have been using to check my dat is correct based on the
drivers. Use a modified version to compare his generated dat with the
drivers that created it. The original script was this:

cmp.bat
=======

@echo off

sh cmp.sh

datutil -m all.txt

mamediff -v datutil.dat Nebula*.dat
grep -v "already in MAME" mamediff.log >tmp.log
gvim tmp.log

rm all.txt tmp.log datutil.log mamediff.dat mamediff.log

mamediff -S -t Nebula*.dat datutil.dat
gvim mamediff.dat

rm datutil.dat mamediff.dat mamediff.log

cmp.sh
======

>all.txt

for i in CPS* cps* neo*
do
        cat $i >>all.txt
        echo >>all.txt
        echo %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% >>all.txt
done

Use a similar script to compare his data against his drivers. If it checks
out then we can start using the WinKawaks method to update our Nebula dat
(i.e. incorporate changes by hand so that mistakes can be spotted). The 'by
hand' process is also important as it helped me recognise new games that
weren't yet in CAESAR (CPS-2, Neo-Geo etc).

Of course, the way to check that a Nebula dat really works is to run the ROM
checknig routines in the emulator (all should be green). If anyone ever
tried to use the 'incorrect' dats that Nebula itself generated they would
have got many red gamed (trust me, I tried it). I do this test for both the
full Nebula dat and supplementary dats.

>The case is: Do we somehow validate the automatic genereated dats?
>If yes how? By running each game one by one?

As you can see from my explanations, I use the generated dats to see what
has changed in the emulators (I normally check the release notes too) then
add the details that I believe are correct for these games into my dats. By
comparing my dat to the auto generated dat I can tell if the emulator author
has made any naming mistakes etc (almost always with Calice, sometimes with
Nebula, rare with Kawaks).

Hope this provides a little insight into things. These are the easy dats
though... when there is no generated dat to play with, things get even more
fun! :)

I scripted up the things needed to check Nebula's generated dat and it is

For the more techy of you who are interested in how I did the check, see the
attached.

- cmp.bat and cmp.sh do the checks

- log1.txt shows errors in the generated dat:

  i) All Neo-Geo clones miss the resource information
  ii) Some games have incorrect merge information
  iii) Some games have incorrect information

  Ignore:

  i) Ignore the 'games requiring additional roms' that don't list any.
     This is a side effect of how the CPS-2 drivers don't list all parent
ROMs.
  ii) PGM games at the bottom (they don't have drivers so they can't be
checked).

- log2.txt shows ROMs mssnig from the Nebula generated dat
