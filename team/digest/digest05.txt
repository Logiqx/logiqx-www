These are the MD5 for the CHD's with a MD5 calculation program:
d9d0338e1d485cbf9111691858b059d6 *area51.chd
1e6d2b43b324f5a4115473fcf4cb0cd0 *maxforce.chd
30a7a9d88261d85df63ead99e474ab21 *vcircle.chd

These are the MD5 as in MAME's cojag driver:
130b330eff59403f8fc3433ff501852b = area51
b0a214c7b3f8ba9d592396332fc974c9 = maxforce
fc316bd92363573d60083514223c6816 = vcircle

The MD5 in MAME is not calculated over the whole CHD file. I don't know the
details, but it makes sense, you don't want to wait for it to read a 1.1gb
file
and calculate a slow checksum each time you fire up the game. I don't know
if
ClrMAMEPro will support the normal MD5 or the MAME MD5, but for manual
testing
with another program (like md5.exe, search in google), the first ones would
be
the ones you want.

Oh, I have written several programs myself that calculate an MD5 (including
one on a property sheet, so it's a on a separate tab when you right-click a
file and choose properties), so I don't have to look for one. :-)

(This is an earlier question not answered earlier cause my brain simply
sucks big
time)
I think Aaron is one of those who understands the limitations of an
error-detection algorithm and would prefer to move to a content
identification
algorithm (CRC vs MD5/SHA-x). I think he simply took the opportunity to not
use
CRC's in this, he could have done it perfectly with just CRC's taken from
different parts of the big file.
Of course now that MD5 made its way into MAME, the fight is to change it to
SHA-x
because MD5 was cracked :/

> Thanks for the information! It matches mine:

Everyone has the same versions since no other versions have been distributed
(save for download errors). The problem was that some people were going to
CRY
cause suddenly the 2.2gb they downloaded painfully were not matching with
MAME...
I just discovered this recently in the MAME board and I don't think it's
widely
spread. I thought the info could fit here, of course.

Another thing: I don't have the CHD's, I'm on 56k. Hopefully that will
change
soon thanks to a very good friend :)

It looks like it will... In the Scanner, there's a Checksums button, press
it
and you'll see checkboxes for:
CRC32
MD5
MD5 in CHD

Actually, Roman sized it wrong so the D got cut off and is only half there.
I'll send him an e-mail after this one.

b0 a2 14 c7 b3 f8 ba 9d 59 23 96 33 2f c9 74 c9

Those are the 16 bytes starting at offset 44 (0x2c) in maxforce.chd. The
other two have their respective MD5s at the same offset. That was easy
enough. :-)

So they check the MD5 by just loading the "header" of the CHDs (the first 60
bytes or maybe a bit more).

Bleh. I just tried creating a full set for Daphne, including all the unused
games and ROMs, and I noticed two things:

(1) Both esh and eshalt have a ROM called f8_is2.bin, but the CRCs differ.
So
I renamed the one in eshalt to f8_is2a.bin. I hope they change the source
code. :-)

(2) eshalt2 uses the same f8_is2.bin as its parent (esh), but they forgot to
merge it in the source code, so it tries to load that one from eshalt2,
while
they could have loaded it from esh. I changed it so it's merged now. And I
hope they change the source code here too. :-)

Forget the previous two. New one attached.

Blame it on cut & paste. Some wrong filenames in firefoxa. Used Dir2Dat and
copied its output into the dat. I thought cut & paste would ensure there
would be no typos. But I didn't notice the firefoxa.zip I had contained
wrong
filenames...

Another one attached. Trash the previous three.

I promise that next time I'm about to send a dat, I won't, but check it once

And I'll continue stopping myself until I've visually checked and

Something I noticed a long time ago, but didn't remember until just now:

Does anyone agree with me that battles (which is a "cloneof xevious") has a
"sampleof xevious" missing? They have the same name and if you listen, they
also sound the same.

If so, should I send an e-mail to submit@mame.net?

Don't worry - I've done that a few times.  Hell, I've pulled 2 extra classic

I'll try to upload the dat tonight but I can't promise it. I didn't get
sleep on Sunday night (working) and seeing as I go on holiday at 4am on
Friday morning, sleep is a very high priority or I won't enjoy my weekend in
Italy.

Regarding the 'unusedroms', being the only emulator that runs these games I
do not think that we should take such ROMs out otherwise people delete the
ROMs then have to go hunting for them again when they are finally used (e.g.
badlands.c4). I learnt this lesson with Final Burn when I re-added 'unused'
ROMs to Thunder Blade about 3 times! The 'unusedgames' is a good idea
though.

Personally I think that we should re-download the supported game ROMs from
the Dragon's Lair Project and see if there are any other ROMs that should be
in the dat ready for the future (which could be included as 'unusedrom'
since there is no point forcing people to get them yet).

No, I think it's more like the MD5/CHD gets embedded in the own file. Which
makes
sense, if you're not going to calculate the MD5 of the whole file, there are
areas you don't look at, hence you can store it there for self-validation.

Btw your profile has been updated.

I sent three non-working RC dats to Razoola, in less than 24h. That was when
Logiqx was out of the planet, and there were some persons who thought I was

Yes, that makes sense as to how they CALCULATE it, but when MAME uses the
CHD, it probably just loads the header and reads the MD5 from there. I think
that's how they CHECK it, because, like you said, it would be very annoying
if it actually calculated it every single time.

If I find some time tonight, I might play with it a little to see if I can
find out exactly which part they calculate the MD5 on.

Well, you did turn 'an06' to an 'unusedrom' but it was enabled in the last
dat release. Since people already have the ROM in their collection (if they
used our last dat) then lets not delete it, in case it is needed in a future
release of Daphne. :)

Yes, like I said, I made every ROM not in the source code an "unusedrom".
But, I agree with you that it's a lot easier for people to update in case it
gets added. Not everyone is like us, NEVER deleting any ROMs. :-)

OK. Dith replied:

"Sounds good to me, if they are the same, merge them."

So I guess he didn't know about it or check. Was I the only one who noticed?
Or do they really sound different to other people? Can anybody check before
I
send an e-mail to submit@mame.net?

Ok I checked and the versions I have sound similar, it's the same style of
sound
effect, but sound really different to me. They just sound like the kind of
effects made with the same sound hardware, but used differently in each
game. To
ensure that we have the same versions, my explo1.wav in battles has crc
740c1a6e
and in xevious it has 0b1af078. IMHO they should not be merged.

Well, remember that Dith cleaned up the ones in Xevious about a year ago,
but
never touched the ones in battles, so they come from somewhere else. Anyway,
maybe I'll just wait and see what happens in 0.62. If battles still doesn't
have a "sampleof xevious" then, I'll just let it slide and assume that in
that clone of Xevious, the sounds really did sound differently.

It's intersting to see that battles only has 2 samples when all other clones
have 4. If I was looking into it and had time I would change the battles
sound driver to match the others to see if all 4 samples get used. This may
indicate if it should use the same samples as the other xevious clones.
Looking at past MAME listinfo may help too (did Xevious used to use 2
samples for example).

Just to clarify the salary scale, it is like this:

Rate in $s/euros (hell, they're close on the same exchange rate):

Standard hours=Dat level divided 2
Unsociable hours=Dat level

So Ben Jos, you are paid the same as Pi. Hey, I've just realised Pi, you are
dat level -17 so you owe me a fortune!

Hope everyone is happy with their rates now. ;)

I have took a look at cottage last night,

103 games are supported,

I have attached preliminary dat.

Unfortunately I don't have a source, and emulator don't support
-listinfo, (or I just could not figured it out).

So I took attached list of games, run datutil -g _name_ -a
from Mame0.61.
Then it turns out there are a few problems (some roms had to be
renamed - some clone info thrown away...)
I have checked it by hand loading each game in Cottage.
All games from this dat works, (though maybe there are some redundant
roms...).

Here we go:

galaxiaj - it should use roms from galaxian but then it doesn't work.
roms 1h.bin, 1k.bin, 6l.bpr - have to be put also in galaxiaj.

mspacman, pacman, theglob uses different roms (then those from MAME) -
this are roms from bootlegs versions (first two) and Pacman Hardware
(theglop rom from Mame).

I couln't make to work last 6 games (all games are in alphabethical
order in menu.htm but this 6, which are at the end).
these are:
arkangc
arkatayt
arkbloc2
boblbobl
sboblbob
tokiob

Also there are some merging information missed, I will have to take a
look at it. But anyway - this dat runs all games. And maybe BenJos
could run his validat on it. It would be helpful.

In which case, we need to remove the cloneof/romof reference to galaxian. If
you don't do this, the rom managers sometimes decide to merge the ROMs.

This always happens to emulators other than MAME. They copy MAME standards
then MAME renames it's, hehe. I can see that you found the right games on
the basis of the ROM names though.

They probably don't work in the emu then. Another 'challenge' when creating
dats is knowing when your dat is wrong and when the emu just doesn't work.
;)

After removing the galaxian reference in galaxiaj, it goes through Validat
fine.

Looks good to me (just needs a clrmamepro header). Great work Leslaw.

Versions 0.30 final through 0.36 final used only two samples for Xevious,
yes. 0.53 and up use 4.

Okay, I think that the final thing to do is amend the MAME source (for
battles) and see if all 4 samples get used.

Looking at the source (drivers/xevious.c), the two sample sections fit on
the same screen so I'm not sure that it is an oversight. There may be a good
reason for it having different samples.

It would be interesting to know if all 4 samples can be used with battles
though. ;)

the last six games:

arkatayt.zip

So i couldn't check which is parent for them. So I have assumed that

though, at the website of cottage it is said that boblbobl should

Got them, thanks. Whilst getting them I also re-organised the FTP again:

Backup - Latest Bin, Dats, Dats_RC and WWW backups
Submissions - Dat submissions (either WIP dats or completed dats, packaged
up in ZIPs along with XML)
ROMs - You know what ;)

Hopefully this structure will allow us to keep it simple and uncluttered.

I like the way that the dat began with a WIP status and then once given the
okay got packaged and uploaded in a state where I can drop it into WWW. :) I
suggest that we do this for all dats from now on.

Tonight I will upload the CottAGE and Daphne dats (I will package Daphne and
do the XML myself this time, hehe). After that, I have to pack for my 3 day
Rome trip and go to bed since I must get up at 3.30am!

Looks good to me. I can see that games that were in CottAGE v0.03 have not
changed (other than the addition of ROM merging) and that all other games
match MAME (with the exception of the last six since they have no parent set
to inherit the ROMs from). I could tell that they match MAME because 'fix
missing' with my MAME ROMs as the 'add path' added all of the ROMs required
(except for those six games already mentioned). Perhaps those six need the
parent ZIP even though the parent is not actually supported? If so, just add
the parents at the bottom of the dat with a little comment above them
sayingthat they are just needed forthe rom managers (I just use a '#' for
comments). I also loaded up CottAGE and ran about a dozen games.

Anyway, it looks great to me. Thanks Leslaw.

Mike

p.s. I may get around to adding CottAGE v0.10 into CAESAR today. That serves
as one final check of the dat quality since CAESAR checks that ROMs in the
dat really belong to each game. I know they are right though because of the
way I updated my sets in CMPro. ;)

Exactly!!!!

boblbobl.zip
sboblbob.zip
tokio.zip

runs if we have bublbobl in the rom directory - which is not
supported.

I need to change the dat.

I forgot to mention earlier that I've updated the team backup areas (both at
logiqx.com and the FTP).

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/

I have removed the seperate tool ZIPs and just provide a full archive of the
'Bin' directory now.

If you don't have Validat by Ben Jos yet, then update your 'Bin' directory
to the latest version. ;)

No fear, I have done it myself since I would like to upload it when I get
home this evening.

I have attached the CottAGE directory so that you can see how I tend to do
dats that need 'dummy' parents. The reason behind this is so that I can use
the true list of games in CAESAR (i.e. no dummy parents) without manually
editing the CAESAR dat each time the emulator is updated. :) Dummy parents
also exist in Calice and used to exist in ACE.

Uploaded CottAGE and Daphne.

- Made an important mod to CottAGE: 'fixmerging split'

- Had to take unused games out of Daphne because DatUtil was not ignoring
them (they were getting into the RomCenter dat), same with MAMEDiff and
probably CAESAR too (seeing as they all use the same type of parser). The
unused games are in a seperate file in the Dats/Recent/Multi/Daphne folder
now.

Also compared our Daphne dat to that other one and they have two additional
ROMs:

game (
 name "cobraconv"
 description "Cobra Command (conversion) [Disabled - Not Working]"
 year 1984
 manufacturer "Data East USA"
 rom ( name vd0-c.bpr size 32 crc 02c27aa0 )
 rom ( name vd0-t.bpr size 32 crc 78449942 )
)

Maybe we should have them as unusedroms? I haven't time to download the ROMs
to check if they really exist.

Currently uploading the latest TARs to the team areas. Signing off now...
got to get up at 3.30am!

Yes, it does contain those in the file from d-l-p. Damn, I must have missed
those because of my habit of comparing zip files against my database and
deleting all the duplicates. So, yes, we should add those as unusedroms.

I wonder if there are any others? When I am back from Rome I may re-download
all of the Daphne ROMs to see what is unused (by doing a CMPro 'show
unneeded').

Ah well - no one has it except Logiqx and me, I think. The story is that
eons ago, when Tom Walker (the Yaame author) started looking into
anteater emulation, he found the graphics scrambled and created a custom
unscrambled graphic rom by hand. Eons later when he actually released
Yaame, the emu still wanted those unscrambled roms, even when they are
not needed anymore since he figured out the real emulation of that part.

Tom Walker is a cool guy, and sent me the roms at request. I don't think
other people has it unless they asked Tom directly for them. More or
less like the junoboot in M72 methinks. I could be wrong of course....

Why are you asking us to commit an illegal act - a crime! Sending
copyrighted material over internet is forbidden by the Digital Millenium
Crappy Act.

So please everyone save these rare to find romz for future generations

Be sure to do a ROMCMP -d between the old and new USA ROMs (to check that
the new dump seems to have some reason behind it). I don't have my ROM

This was piece a cake - Mike has wrote everything, only needs to put

Only one game was added - sfzch, appart that nothing has changed.

Take a look and let me know - But since it is generated automatically

Thanks. That shows that the 2nd half of all regions now match and the first
half only has minor differences. The USA redump therefore makes sense (seems
the first half was already okay but the second half didn't match the other
regions; a givaway of badness in the case of Strider 2).

I have a question about Yaame,
In last release there are "unusedroms" used.
(First what is the reason for that? ClrMAME even though the roms are
marked unusedroms deletes them, so what's this for).
Anyway, now there are no source code of Yaame - we cannot check for
sure whether some roms are used or not.
I can give you an example: Blockout - this is newly supported game.
(it runs without sound - at least author doesn't indicate it runs with
sound so taking a look at Mame -listinfo)

        name blockout
        description "Block Out (set 1)"
        year 1989
        manufacturer "Technos + California Dreams"
        rom ( name bo29a0-2.bin size 131072 crc b0103427 region cpu1 offs 0
)
        rom ( name bo29a1-2.bin size 131072 crc 5984d5a2 region cpu1 offs 1
)
        rom ( name bo29e3-0.bin size 32768 crc 3ea01f78 region cpu2 offs 0 )
        rom ( name bo29e2-0.bin size 131072 crc 15c5a99d region sound1 offs
0 )
        rom ( name mb7114h.25 size 256 crc b25bbda7 region proms offs 0 )

so bo29e2-0.bin we can set as a unusedrom, probably also prom is not
used - so also unused rom. Well and game without these two loads.
Fine.
But then I can remove bo29e3-0.bin and game loads fine!!!
In fact it loads also without bo29a1-2.bin - just the graphic is
garbled.

So how I can tell which roms is really necessary? Isn't it better to
not use unusedrom at all?

Hi logiqx,
It's nice to see you back at work! :D
I've recently build the "old arcade emulator sets" using your dat pack.
Rombuilder has been very useful...

I've a question about the sound samples.

In two cases (sideway and magex), the samples i've found on caesar doesn't
match with the filenames required by the dats.

for istance the sideway dat for boothill requires:

SND2.WAV
SND4.WAV
SND5.WAV
SND6.WAV
SND7.WAV

but in the zipfile i've

GUNSHOT.SAM
ENDGAME.SAM
Addcoin.sam
KILLED.SAM.

Same thing for magex samples: diffent names, and the ones in the zipfile
seem to be the right ones (the emulator plays them).

Am i doing something wrong? Please lemme know!

Thanks in advance,

When it comes to creating a dat, I suspect that the system dats like Neo-Geo
(sound ones) can be utilised in the same way that I do for NeoJukeBox,
Nebula Jukebox, etc.

Hi all,

MAME v0.62 has been released just in time for us to get everything done
before I go on holiday (gone for over a week, beginning on Saturday). Please
help out as much as you can. The ideal situation would be for many people to

better. :) I will have plenty to do relating to CAESAR too. ;)

Hi people

I've updated the datlist with a couple minor changes besides the
MAME 0.62 release. Logiqx told me to use the dependencies list to
check what needs to be checked, but a) I am not sure that I can
interpret it well and b) it seems that other than automatically
generated supplements, you only have to take care about Neogeo's
Blues Journey new dump and the usual CPS2 xor/parent dance. At
first glance there are no other changes in systems supported by
MAME.

The new mame has around 130 new games, and not 91 like the
whatsnew.txt states. It took 131 days, so that makes one game per
day, curious. It's also the biggest release until date, but being
also the slowest that's not surprising at all. The new roms size
is around 430mb without the CHD's (mamediff supertiny).
Surprising enough in my case, I'm on 56k and I will have to
download around 5 or maybe 6 megs of roms, I had all the rest
already :-p

I will be a bit busy until the weekend so further updates might
be slow, sorry for it.

I keep them there incase the author suddenly adds sound support or uses
PROMs. It is quicker and easier to add them in if they are already in the
dat in an unused state. ;) The exception to this is newly emulated games
where I leave even unused ROMs active.

0 )
>         rom ( name bo29a1-2.bin size 131072 crc 5984d5a2 region cpu1 offs
1 )

Main CPU code and GFX.

0 )
>         rom ( name bo29e2-0.bin size 131072 crc 15c5a99d region sound1
offs 0 )

Sound CPU and samples.

>         rom ( name mb7114h.25 size 256 crc b25bbda7 region proms offs 0 )

Colour PROMs.

If the other games don't use PROMs then it is a fair bet that this new one
doesn't either. If it doesn't support sound and loads without the two sound
related ROMs then they are of no use.

> But then I can remove bo29e3-0.bin and game loads fine!!!

That's the sound CPU. ;)

The emulator not complaining of missing ROMs is a bit poor really. The game
would definitely need that ROM as you found out.

PROMs and sound related stuff (CPU 2 etc) are unused.

Asunto: [TeamLogiqx] Dats updated... packagers needed!

Whilst still working, I managed to run the dat updates required. Everything
has been updated and uploaded to the team FTP (Dats.zip, Dats_RC.zip) but in
ZIP format (don't have my backup scripts here).

What remains to be done is the checking/testing and packaging of all the
updated dats:

Multi/MAME                                 Automatic
   Multi/FBA (Supplements)                 Automatic
   Multi/Final Burn (Supplements)          Automatic
   Multi/MAME (Changes)                    Automatic
   Multi/MAME (Supplements)                Automatic
   Multi/Nebula (Supplements)              Automatic
   Multi/RAINE (Supplements)               Automatic
   Multi/WinKawaks (Supplements)           Automatic
   Systems/CPS-1                           Semi-Automatic
      Systems/CPS-1 (QSound)               Manual
         Sound/Nebula Jukebox              Automatic
         Sound/NeoJukeBox                  Automatic
         Sound/QPlayer                     Automatic
      Systems/CPS-1 (YM-2151 + OKI6295)    Manual
         Sound/Nebula Jukebox              Automatic
      Systems/CPS-1 (Supplements)          Automatic
   Systems/CPS-1 (Supplements)             Automatic
   Systems/CPS-2 (Supplements)             Automatic
   Systems/Neo-Geo                         Semi-Automatic
      Systems/Neo-Geo (Sound)              Manual
         Sound/Nebula Jukebox              Automatic
         Sound/NeoJukeBox                  Automatic
      Systems/Neo-Geo (Supplements)        Automatic
   Systems/Neo-Geo (Supplements)           Automatic

Notes:
1) Although CPS-1 did not change, I updated it so that the readme mentions
MAME v0.62.
2) The sound ROMs in bjourney (Neo-Geo) changed and that resulted in the
sound dat updates.
3) Any supplements that were regenerated should be checked to see if they
have changed (things like CPS-2 definitely will have).
4) MAME Changes can't be generated yet since there is a fundamental change
that needs making to MAMEDiff. Previously, all resource ROMs in clones could
be found in their parent but with the new system this is not true. If Ben
Jos wants to try fixing it, it's the 'fix merging' function. ;)

I have also dropped the latest resource dats into the workarea so that they
have been rebuilt too and need packaging.

There is now much packaging to be done! I won't get a chance to do any more
emu stuff tonight so if someone could make a start I would be very, very
grateful. I am going to be overloaded at work until Friday ends and then I
have things to do before my holiday. ;)

I am currently uploading Dats.tar.gz and Dats_RC.tar.gz to the usual team
areas. I have tested all of these dats on my collections but they now need
packaging. The TARs contain updates for all of the dats shown below:

> Multi/MAME                                 Automatic

>       Systems/Neo-Geo (Supplements)        Automatic
>    Systems/Neo-Geo (Supplements)           Automatic

It also contains updates for these:

> MAME Cabinets
> MAME Icons
> MAME Snaps
> MAME Titles

...and RAINE v0.36.2 (needed the sound CPU fixing in sfzch - it had wrong
size and also needed the supplement to be for MAME v0.62).

Note: MAME Changes can't be generated at this time because MAMEDiff needs a
bugfix.

I think that is all the MAME related dat updates dealt with but I still have
ROMBuild to check and CAESAR to update. I would therefore very much
appreciate it if people could package that lot up for me. ;)

Just in time for my datlist page update! :-p

Does this means that all these dats can be again put as *done*? The
supplements
for the rest of emus also worked well? (I suposse since no one uses the new
resources but I just want to be sure)

Second point: there is no *real* raflsiau set, there are two different fake
ones
with different bytes changed. They are the normal set with some bytes
changed to
fake the crc's.

Third point. There is someone needing an update in the team page but well
I'd
prefer to do it when I do the contacts :-p If i can. Some day. Soon. Maybe.
Before 0.63 I promise.

They still need packaging. Maybe a new colour should show that? ;)

I have updated the dependency page to explain how it is to be read (since
there is obviously some confusion):

http://www.logiqx.com/team/depend.html

It is very important that active members understand this page so if you are
unsure, please ask for more explanation.

People of the Earth, specifically team members:

I've updated the list again, marked in PINK (hehehe) the dats
which are done but needs packaging. If I am right, we have some
packagers but only one uploader, Mike. He is going on holidays.
So if you don't help him packaging them, they can't be released
until he comes back. That means that the world will have to live
DAYS without the dats!!!!! How can it be permissible, she
compromises my principles....

Worse, I will not be able to update my own romziez! Last night I
was able to complete the task but I can't be 100% sure if the
dats don't come from the datcave. And if you don't help
packaging, Mike will not have time to fix mamediff, you will get
bad karma, hair will fall and chicks will not dig you.

I updated the stuff to do with the new resource (attached) but didn't go any
further when I discovered the funny merging issue. It is probably as simple
as using is_resource_rom() within fix_merging() and may only take 5 minutes
but I am too busy here at work. ;)

And actually one of the reasons I asked about MAME's test drivers before...

I really believe in giving credit where credit is due...

I really hate people stealing things and claiming those things as their
own...

I hate people cashing in on other people's work. And I've had that happen to
me, so maybe that's why I feel even more strongly about it.

"All the informations are exactly as reported by MAME.
There may be some errors."

That's from the guy (CCT) who has been submitting Testdriver dats to Roman
for the past several versions...

Why even put your name on there if the quote is all you did?

There are lots of errors in it. All you did was, probably, change ONE
#define, and did a "mame -listinfo >testdrivers.dat".

Why claim credit? Within a matter of 2 minutes, I fixed ALL the errors in
that dat...

And I know there is at least one Italian guy on the team... I hope it isn't
the same one...

Come on, if you release a dat in your name, then at least make it somewhat
correct... what value did CCT add that made him think he could claim it his
and remove everyone else involved in the credits?

I'm sorry.

Maybe I shouldn't, but sometimes I just can't resist.

Sorry to you, especially, Mike... I still remember what you said when you
invited me to become a member of the team.

I'd better stop now.

Ben Jos.

If there's anything any member of the team is looking for, just let me know.
I do NOT have have "insider information" (like access to the MAMEdev FTP),
but I do have quite a nice collection of things. And, at the very least, I'm
probably a serious contender for the largest ratio of "ROMs owned vs. games
interested in". ;-)

For RAINE, that's what pretty much what everyone is missing... I don't have
them, and I'm pretty sure no one else here does.

Anyway... here's an offer from me to everyone on the team:

Send me a VALID ClrMamePro/listinfo dat file containing JUST what you're
missing and I'll run it against my database and let you know what I have.
I've written my program to ONLY deal with ClrMamePro/listinfo dat files...
which SHOULDN'T be a problem for anyone on the team. :-)

No problem about the Rant Ben Jos. I have had the same happen to me before I
became good friends with Roman and took control of the RomCenter dat page
(muwwahahaha - evil laugh). It is very annoying for people to submit updates
to replace your own work and introduce many errors in the process. Some
people have had the cheek to add a couple of games to the NeoRAGEx dat and
rip my name out... after all the effort I put in to actually figure out the
dumps it needs and write ROMBuild. Days, maybe weeks and all they did took
10 minutes!

If you want to start an official Logiqx testdrivers dat Ben Jos, you are
more than welcome. I am sure that Roman will only use ours if I speak to
him. Hell, he fended off several people trying to overule my U64Emu dat
until he and I had discussed it thoroughly for a few days.

Asunto: [TeamLogiqx] A couple of quick notes

Just a couple of things to mention having looked at my mailbox this morning:

1) Please use ZIP (PC) or GZ (Unix) for all archives posted to this list, no
RAR or ACE etc.

2) If talking to one person then please take the conversation off the list
(e.g. 9 messages about Johnny's missing list should really have been just 2;
Johnny asking and Ben Jos saying that he was helping).

This is no criticism of anyone, I just want to keep the list down to stuff
that is relevant. Swapping ROMs between ourselves is fine (all in the name
of dat creation of course) but lets not fill everyone's mailbox about it. ;)

Nice to see you re-appearing though Johnny. :)

Mike

Reminder:

If things aren't packaged when I get up tomorrow morning then they will not
be uploaded to the public for at least another 10 days. This would be very
poor with there being so many of us! I've already spent about 4 hours doing
dat updates, testing, releasing, MAMEDiff fix, ROMBuild check, CAESAR
update, etc. Please, please, please help me here by spending 30 minutes to
an hour ZIPing stuff up ready for me. ;)

The team has been getting going nicely so let's not fail to deliver at the
busiest time. ;)
