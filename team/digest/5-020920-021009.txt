Multi stands for "multiple game emulator". Systems have nothing to do with
this. And in many cases it's *hard* to decide where a game system ends and
where not. When we were building CAESAR, there was some talking about how
to explicitly define which emus were multi and which ones were not. In the
end we (he) decided that if an emulator supported games in different MAME
sets, it was multi. So an emu for Pacman and Ms.Pacman would be "multi",
whereas one emu.
(Ok he decided that but the idea was mine to polish is already existing
organization scheme. I did not do too much for CAESAR but I put my grain of
sand)

The Single folder is for emus which only support games in the same set
(that set being defined as MAME says, regardless of the hardware). The
System folder is for games in the same system, regardless of which emulator
support the games. You will even see some non-supported games in them
(unxored cps2 for example).

Think of it as in MAME games: there is one "name" like sdgndmps and then a
"description" like "SD Gundam Psycho Salamander no Kyoui" (I loved this
example!) In this case, the name would be viva_nonno (identifier for RC2
headers and CAESAR), and the description would be "Viva Nonno". Since not
even in the official site the space is clear, maybe Mike made a little
mistake. If he discovers that it makes you impossible to audit your roms,
I'm sure he will fix it :) If not, well, will be fixed in next update LOL

If the game is undumped, then the CRC will be null (0x00000000). If it's
dumped, then somehow the CRC's will be known and hence could be included in
the dat correctly. I am not sure if this game is released, but probably
it's dumped since VN supports it. Another thing is that you or me can find
the roms, maybe they are being hoarded.

> (Note: this is NOT a rom request in any form! it's a delicate subject,

Well we've not talked about these. But if you do a datfile, you are
supossed to test it. How? auditing your own romsets! For that you will need
roms. Now there is no solution for that but I'm sure somehow in not a very
far future we will have this problem solved ;)

No morality discussion here, sorry. For that, go to your local lawyer or
talk to your priest. Or whatever you have :)

Hello people

Well Logiqx is out, will not come back in 9-10 days, so BEHAVE.

I simply *can't* solve all your doubts about all this datfile
mess, but I will answer when I know what to answer. So everyone
has plenty of lessons to read and exercises to practice, you can
redo the dats Logiqx did and see if they are different.

Don't worry about what is going to come or not, just stick with
what's already explained by Logiqx. People with troubles PLEASE
post your doubts in the list, and people who has passed
successfully the lessons, PLEASE help them.

As for me, I'm WAY behind maintaining the team page. I've updated
the index a bit (there is IMPORTANT information in it). I will
post there the remaining lessons since some people seem to have
had probs with the list lately. I'll post also the digests,
finally. The thign is that right now I'm going out, so I'll do it
during the weekend.
And don't forget to visit me at CAESAR!!! (shit now I realize I
forgot to put that link in the site, damn me!)

So basically "holidays" until Datman Returns. Anyone wants me to
explain how to start a good pic collection like I did with Chloe
Jones? :)

so there will be an "S22" folder some day?
there is a dumped S22 rom (victlap) not supported by VivaNonno
as of today...

Well probably Mike would like something more like "Namco System 2x",
grouping the same batch of hardware, you know. But I know he will not do it,
and actually I'd bet that he would put it as exercise: "creating a system
dat from emulator dats" or something.

The only l33t things Logiqx gets is the CPS2 data before XOR releases, and
that's like some hours before the releases so he can prepare the datfile. I
don't think Logiqx gets anything else which other persons don't get.

You're right, we don't have any rights, legal or moral, over the roms. BUT
something inside us tells us that it's not bad to have the PacMan roms, and
play the game. We feel like it's even something positive, even when legally
and morally speaking we know it's not 100% right. But in fact, anything we
say to convince us that it's right are just excuses.

In my case, where the PacMan case is clear, it's not so clear about KOF2000.
Maybe about KOF94, or even KOF96, but not about 2k... Strange, uh? Not many
people say they don't agree with the 2-year delay in mame, cause it's SHORT
hahahahah (Vincent Price's evil laugh)

This is not a morality discussion, each one is free to think what he wants,
as long as it doesn't open the ozone hole again... :)

You can't. The amount of messages and text I can write on a day is by far
much more than you would be able to read in one week. When Logiqx comes
back, ask him if I do write many emails... It's just that lately I'm in low
shape. But still you can't make me crazy with questions. I'm already crazy

Well you will be surprised, Logiqx can have some good ideas, I mean the
kind of ideas which build up books, you know? I think he will say something
similar to me, which is: Legally, having roms is illegal, and morally, it
shouldn't be illegal.
What I don't agree is the timeline. For MAME, it's 2 years. For me, it
should be *at least* five years. There are very few people who think that
the 2 years limit is also not enough... But well, those are details.

I'll have to place a link for the Emulation FAQ, which is a case study
about the legality of emulation and all related activities. It's one of the
most interesting pieces of information about emulation I've ever read, and
it's still a great piece related to legality of emulation. Tho it's a bit
heavy and long, it gives an historical perspective to the emulation world
that no other paper or "hey we've emulated sys22" has done. Not all of you
will read it, but well, for me it's a must for real emulation lovers.
Recently I also posted in CAESAR a link about an article in MobyGames
regarding legality and abandonware, which pretty much fits with the roms
subject, I'll try to find it.

Happy birthday Stefan! You know, there is a tradition in Team Logiqx (well
a tradition which has just started NOW) that when a member has his
birthday, he has to tell us the story of his nick.

Potentially but I think it unlikely. The reason I create system dats is
because many emulators support the systems (including all of the sound
emulators like QPlayer, QSound Player, NeoJukebox etc). Currently there is
only one S22 emulator so I think that a dat is overkill. ;)

The CRCs for the unavailable sets came from the readme be the author. In
such circumstances this is the only thing that we can go on.

My advice is just to keep quiet in public and if you have ROMs then not to
mention them, via e-mail or forum. The dats and CAESAR are in my opinion a
huge contribution towards documenting gaming history but that doesn't give
us any right to hold other peoples copyrighted material. Of course, having
them doesn't harm anyone financially, so long as we don't spread them widely
(plenty of other sites seem to enjoy taking that risk). ;)

I don't think that any game company is hugely worried about old games
(except if they sell ports or emulators themselves) but when it starts
impacting current game takings then they will take notice. This is why I
agree with emulator authors not doing really new stuff on CPS-2 and Neo-Geo.

any
rom kiddiez on the NG board whining about if it has been dumped. There was
not
too much hype about Rage of the Dragons. I think the rom kiddiez were

hm NeoGeo is a different story in my oppionion, it's not SNK
anymore, all the glory is gone... Eolith did a good job in
reviving the old system, even though they were aware of the
almost perfect emulation (raster effects still aren't complete,
right?). Maybe they should've concentrated on the NeoGeo64...
I personally like MS4, it's like the prequels, everytime I
play it, I find something new in the games :)

about the emu kidz, I wonder why Emuchina shut down the English
site and bbs...

  > About CPS2, really emu authors have NOTHING to do ;)

that's the big Raz story ---
although I doubt that he has dumped/ha-xored the 2001/02 pcbs ...

I'm just collecting roms for my own personal enjoyment,
never intended to spread them to the whole world...

Roms should be free because...
Programmers are artists in their own way, so every piece of
software (even WindowsXP or MacOS X) is considered to be a
piece of art and to be made available to the public for free
or a minimal fee.
Roms are art too (NeoGeo or CPS2 games are pure art)...

btw, are there any Open-Source or PD arcade games (except
NeoNoPon) yet?

Hi,

I've looked over them and they were pretty much perfect (uploaded to
logiqx.com too).

The only thing to mention is that filenames containing spaces need to use
%20 in the XML (for the HTML). If you don't do this then Netscape users
start complaining about broken links, hehe.

De: "Logiqx" <logiqx@logiqx.com>

I have just updated 3 more dats for logiqx.com (FBA, Daphne, RAINE) and made
some improvements to 'Dats' and 'Dats_RC' at the same time.

1) I have created sub-directories for files that relate to a particular
version of each emulator. For example: mame.exe, fba.exe, Nebula drivers,
etc. See the attached PNG for an illustration. Files within these
directories are either used for automatic dat generation, to verify newly
created dats or identify ROM changes in an emulator (all actions are
scripted so that you can see what is possible). Old directories can be
deleted when a new version of the emulator comes out.

2) All scripts have been renamed to have a '_' at the beginning of them.
With more dats being added to the environment it makes it easier to find the
script when it is above all other files. ;)

3) The makefiles now hide the output of DatUtil and MAMEDiff. Instead, they
just output a simple message to say what is going on. Much easier on the
eyes! :)

4) The makefiles in 'Dats_RC' are better written, using the 'subst' function
to reduce the amount of times that each filename is included. This will make
'copy and pasting' much simpler.

5) I have created a script called '_check_merging.bat' (re-download
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/tools-logiqx.zip) so that you can use
it. This script does a datutil 'fix merging' (-m option) and compares it
with the original dat. If there is a difference then it is shown so that we
can correct our master dat. This highlighted problems a few minor problems
that I have now corrected:

- In Viva Nonno I forgot to compliment a CRC of a bad ROM (I complimented it
in the parent but not in the clone).
- In Daphne one of the 'merge' names was incorrect.
- In MAME, there were a few ROMs that weren't completely fixed. Basically,
you need to do a 'fix merging' twice to guarantee that everything is fixed.
I'll explain why later! Anyway, I have changed the MAME makefile to do two
fix merges.

Finally, because of the changes you should delete your 'Dats' and 'Dats_RC'
directories (back them up if you wish) and redownload these:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats.zip
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats_RC.zip

They include the three new dats (so that you can see what I have done) and
preliminary areas for Laser, Calice and Mimic. Currently these areas just
contain comparison scripts so that we can see what is new in the meulators
but they will be interesting for you to look at.

Got to go out now and won't have access to my e-mail until tomorrow. I am
sure you will manage ok without me though. ;)

Hi everyone, a few things to mention today.

1) As you may have noticed on the logiqx.com site, I've updated a few more
dats.

Most of these address problems that '_check_merging.bat' reported (I have
now checked every single dat for merge problems). ACE is the only genuine
dat update (added sgemf).

2) There is a new '_check_merging.sh' that shows CRC conflicts too (needed
for Calice). You can get it by re-downloading:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/tools-logiqx.zip

3) I have improved the dat makefiles after considering Stefan's comments:

>I noticed some spelling differences, e.g. in the rebuild_all.mak
>first it is "Viva Nonno" (= "Viva?Nonno"), then in line #8 it is
>spelled "viva_nonno"; in the WWW folder it's spelled "VivaNonno"
>and inside the dat files again "Viva Nonno xxxxx".

The lower-case reference (e.g. viva_nonno) is no longer used. Instead, it
uses a name that matches the rest of the makefile rules (i.e. Viva?Nonno).

We are left with just 3 variants now but that is for good reason:

Viva Nonno - The 'human' name for dat files, ZIPs etc
Viva?Nonno - The question mark is required within makefile rules
VivaNonno - The XML entity name (website directory corresponds for
consistency). Reason, XML identifiers can not have space in them.

So, we are now as consistent as we can be considering we use 3 different
technologies (regular files for humans, makefile rules, XML entities). ;)

4) I updated all makefiles that simply 'cp' (i.e. copy) dats or txt files,
now they all use the 'subst' trick. This is much better than before, imho.

5) U64Emu is now officially 'old', lol.

6) For the latest Dats/Dats_RC and WWW directories, use these links:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats.zip
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats_RC.zip
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/WWW.zip

After a while I am sure that these wholesale changes will cease and we can
start distributing individual directories for each emulator. ;)

7) I made a start (and almost finished) the Calice dat, just
mslug4/mslug4n/kof2001 to add (when we have figured out the correct dump to
use).

Calice is a manually-intensive dat! You will see in the latest 'Dats'
directory (download from URL above) that there is a comparison script for
Calice that can compare the drivers in two Calice releases and the latest
dat against the latest driver. Using this I was able to see which games were
added (or changed) then look at the Calice drivers to figure out which dump
is really required (he doesn't always use the right ZIP name). David has a
habit of getting ZIP names and ROM names incorrect so after copying a game
from the CPS-2 dat I checked every single ROM name and corrected it in my
dat where Calice uses the wrong name. Incorrect ROM names cause many CRC
conflicts (shown by '_check_merging.bat/.sh') but these are unavoidable.
Calice doesn't load by CRC so it is better for us to have conflicts in the
dat and let the ROM managers sort out the mess. At least by using the names
he desires (albeit with conlicts), out comparison scripts don't show any
errors in our dat. ;)

Tonight I don't plan on doing any computer-based work other than:

- Packaging the remaining resources and uploading to logiqx.com.
- Updating CAESAR for the emulators that we have recently released dats for.
- Updating my resource collections.
- Updating my Dad's website.

That lot will probably take a couple of hours, so afterwards I will just
relax for the rest of the evening! Maybe do the shopping and tidy up the
house too. ;)

know what dumps are correct for mslug4 and kof2001.

If anyone has any useful information it would be much appreciated. I have
these dumps on my HD, ready for me to look at:

I can see that a few of you have been following the lessons and have a
working environment set up (stefan/rosewood, rob, leslaw/sla,
andrea/dr.zero). Has anyone else been successfully following the lessons?

I have updated the web copies (http://www.logiqx.com/team/) to look a bit
prettier and also include the changes that were made as we went along.
Anyone who hasn't followed the lessons yet but wishes to do so should
therefore use the web versions since they are easier to read and don't
reference things that no longer matter.

Well, I was trying to but.... just couldn't understand....
Lets say I'm the one to do minor important things nobody wants to do ;) that
would be ok with me.

I have now added all of the remaining dats into our environment. :)

I also made updates to CPS-1, Neo-Geo, Nebula Jukebox, NeoJukeBox and
QPlayer. These are all available in the big ZIPs at
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/ (currently uploading, slowly for some
reason).

There are only 3 dats that need updates now! CottAGE, Laser and Mimic. Once
I have done these we will have everything in place for people to try any dat
they feel like the next time an emulator is updated. :)

I did want to explain these updates in a lesson tonight but due to the fact
I was in a traffic jam coming back from work I only have a few seconds
remaining before I must leave the house again! Basically the system dats are
built from part of the MAME dat and the sound dats for systems are
maintained by hand (cross checked by scanning a full system set). The sound
emulator dats are built from the sound systems dats (fully automatic). I'll
explain it properly another day!

Asunto: [TeamLogiqx] Task for anyone who is free!

I have made the first draft for Mimic and Laser but I want to test them
properly (i.e. load every game).

If anyone fancies doing the task then it would be most appreciated. Attached
are CMPro dats to build the sets for testing.

I know a few games definitely won't work in Laser (earthinv, superinv,
beaminv and ozmawar2) but there may be some other games where I have got the
name incorrect or the ROM names incorrect (this is the purpose of testing
;) ). This is wholy expected so I have provided src.zip that contains
information about correct names. The actual  ROM sizes and CRCs should all
be correct though. Examples of things that may be incorrect are games like
invaders1 which I have probably got wrong; it should be in a directory
called 'invadersl' (i.e. in the dat) but run using the name 'invaders1'.

Mimic is also a bit of a pain. It hangs on my Win2K P4 machine and only just
runs on my P233 Win98. I have to test games by loading them and if they
start I know the dat is correct, then ctrl-alt-delete to kill the emulator
and load the next game!

These dats have not been tested by me at all yet so I fully expect a few
problems to be found. ;)

Mike

p.s. a list of all games to test in Laser is included in src.zip (driver.c)
