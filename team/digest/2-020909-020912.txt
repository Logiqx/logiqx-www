Ok,
I don't know how you made it work but I am glad I'm on the list now.
As this is my first mail to Team Logiqx I am going to introduce myself.

My name is Phil and I'm a 17-year-old guy from Germany... (timezone
--> GMT +1)
I'm propably the 'fledgling' of the team ;)
I will finish school in 2004 so things start to get serious now.
The reason that made me join Team Logiqx was my wish to be grateful
for what Mike did!
I had so much fun fixing the games that I thought I want to give him
something back!
The only prob about this is that I'm propably the most bloodiest noob
you can ever imagine!
If I will stay in the Team you will have to start at Adam & Eva with me!

I won't be disappointed or angry if you would kick me cos I'm no use for
the team.... I will understand that...

So what can I do to get started with all this? (...but remember Adam &
Eva!!)
I'm interested in emulators like Kawaks, Nebula, Raine, WinUAE &
PinMame.

Most of the mails some team members have sent lately doesn't make much
sense to me =/
I think I'm to bad missing experience with this....

anyway,
it's ur decision if I'm any use...

greets,

Phil

You'll need CygWin installed to use such cmomands.

'sh' is a Unix shell (kind of like a DOS environment on a PC). Unix
scripting is far more powereful than DOS scripting so I often use it instead
(hence the batch script calling an sh script).

Don't worry about experience. So long as people are well behaved then they
can stay on the list and will gradually learn stuff through their
attendance. Some of the stuff I covered yersterday was a little complicated
but I posted it because Leslaw and Dr. Zero are familiar with dat creation
already and would benefit from it.

I plan to start getting some things up to date soon (MAME and CPS-2 first).
I will explain exactly what I do and then newbies can try repeating the
process so that they understand how it works. Do not worry about the
complicated scripting and comparison work yet, not everyone needs to be
capabale of that. ;)

Over the next few weeks I'm sure we'll get an idea of what tasks we are all
capable of and allocate things accordingly. It may turn out that some people
simply keep an eye out for updates that are necessary and gather
information. Other people may own one or more of the dats but I don't want
this to be too regimented. I want to allow people to do things that they are
happy about and capable of.

Just drop a quick note to the mailing list and Pi will update the page.

It's better this way because several people updating such a page could lead
to changes getting lost (one person overwriting another person's changes).

S>yeah, but this we can do nothing about.
S>as i remember well two games were affected.

It is one of two things:

- Sometimes it is a completely incorrect CRC causing the conflict (i.e. ROM
from a completely different game) which means we can simply use the correct
one.
- Other times it is just the ROM name that is wrong and in this circumstance
we can give it the correct name (since I know the correct CPS-2 ROM names).

Either way, we can create a dat without conflicts and report the correct
driver fix to ElSemi (as I always have done in the past).

I will look into which scenario it is when I actually get around to that
dat.

L> Mike, a.k.a. the dat scripting God. lol.
S>yup.

Hopefully. :)

Anyway, people need not worry about the ability to write such scripts. I can
do that and other people simply have to understand how to interpret the
results.

Yes, 'grep' prints lines matching a pattern (called a regular expression in
Unix). The -v option does the opposite (i.e. prints lines not containing the
pattern).

Sorry for the flood. I did not intend for it to happen this way so let's all
hold back on asking questions until I have things under control. I will soon
have things at a point where I can start passing on my skills and I'll title
those e-mails 'LESSON 1', 'LESSON 2' etc.

Only two posts contain useful/important info right now but they are quite
complex. Only people familiar with dat creation, DatUtil and MAMEDiff will
understand them. If you did understand my posts then great, if you did not
then do not worry about it, I did not expect everyone to understand them.
The content rich posts were:

[TeamLogiqx] Explanation of MAME, Kawaks, Nebula, FB/FBA
[TeamLogiqx] Nebula dat still wrong...

Okay, so that I can get things moving I have constructed this page:

http://www.logiqx.com/Team/team.html

Can you please let me know (post to the teamlogiqx) what you believe you are
currently capable of in terms of these columns:

Role
----

Apprentice - here to watch and learn
Dat Packager - can obtain resource dats from their home (MAME32QA etc),
re-zip and update the web page XML (prior to upload).
Dat Creator - as the name implies
Lurker - for Pi. Just kidding, lol.

Dat Complexity - for dat creators
--------------

1 - Can handle very simple dats
2 - Can handle medium complexity dats
3 - Can handle the most complex of dats (invent scripts for validation etc).

Packager - Yes or No
--------

Only people with a role of 'Dat packager' or 'Dat creator' should say 'Yes'.
Some dat creators may not be prepared to do such a mundane activity though.
;)

Uploader
--------

Currently just me. Until we are operating effectively I don't want the added
confusion of lots of people uploading stuff. ;)

Answering these questions is important as it serves three very useful
purposes:

1) Everyone can see who can do what
2) I will know what audience to target in my 'lesson' posts at.
3) I can hand out some tasks to people and get things moving.

I fully expect people to become more capable over time and the page will be
updated to reflect this. I also expect it will have other niformation like
who owns which dats. However, for now I just need a rough idea of where you
think you stand so that I can get things going.

I'm hoping Pi will be updating this page but I haven't heard from him yet.

Mike

Hi everyone,

to Mike (hope you don't mind that I dislike nicks (even urs is very nice)):
http://www.logiqx.com/Team/team.html <--- very useful and interesting
thing!

My role: definitely 'Apprentice' !
But I'm willing to learn ^_-

the only thing I did concerning dats and emus and stuff was fixing my
games with ....(~running for cover~) RomCenter !!! ...for which I
used Logiqx' dats ^_^

I tried to get into ClrMamePro several times but this program is just
confusing me with it's millions of checkboxes everywhere and more
than 5 menus and what not...

Could someone explain to me what ClrMamePro can that RC doesn't?!
To me it seems that in the end they are both doing exactly the same
with the only difference that RC is less complicated, looks better and
is much more simple!

Try to supress the desire to flame me for this ;)
Thx for answers,

I can't speak for the rest of the team, but I wouldn't worry about lacking
experience.  A year ago, I didn't know anything relevant to this kind of
work.  Now, thanks to Logiqx and his various programs, I can update a couple
of smaller dats and update the XML for CAESAR for these dats.  A little
patience makes this work less overwhelming. :)

Talk to you soon,
Rob

>From my point of view it is better for dat creation for a few reasons:

- Dat errors are far more likely to show up in CMPro.
- It offers me more control over what it is doing.
- It's scan results are very useful during dat creation/validation.
- CMPro has a better file format.

In the past, some of RomCenter's handling of weird cases (merging errors
etc) has not been ideal but it is much better nowadays. RomCenter is still a
great tool though, hence my support for it. I just use CMPro as my master
tool and generate RomCenter dats using DatUtil.

I have no problem with other people in the team using RomCenter as their
first choice but any dats created need to be done in CMPro format first and
then converted to RomCenter for testing. ;)

I also started with RC (hell, I even beta-test!) and found CMP to be awkward
and non-user-friendly.  With time (and patience), I learned to use CMP and
now it's my rom manager of choice (sorry Eric...).

I agree with you - RC is less complicated, looks better and is much simpler.
However, CMP wins when it comes to power.  In RC, you have to select 'Fix
this' or 'Fix that', and sometimes a bad choice of context locks RC up
rather badly (a good example: try fixing icons.zip...).  In CMP, you simply
check 'Fix' for whatever item you want (hint: don't check 'Fix Unneeded' if
you're scanning your MAME roms with a CPS-2 dat - no, I haven't done this
:p).  I have only used the Rebuilder once, although it went very well.
Also, once you set up CMP properly, life is easier.

Talk to you soon,

If I remember right, I have find a .ram fine in another ROM SET, maybe
"Sonic Arcade Beta" for SEGA System 32, and referred to that set a dumper (I
don't remeber who) say me that that file is a sort of "subproduct" of
dumping process, that may help the emulator author to make emulator, repeat
I'm not sure of this, but for sure it isn't tha file we are searching for.

However I think that Logiqx may know more about "astormbl.ram", hope :-)

I think that my role will be "Dat Creator", first because I like the
"tricky" of make dat, and second because this will be a good mode to help
emulation community with my knowledge (hope), about my skill, I think that
handle "medium complexity dat" isn't a problem for me hope that with your
help, and with effort of the team, in the near future can handle most
complexity dat, like nebula one [ElSemi docet]. I response yes to package
answer too, however this isn't my first role ;-), at least I have very basic
knowledge of HTML, XML, etc and therefore this role isn't for me, there are
more prepared guy in the list that can do this.

hi all,

after some troubles joining the list and some heavy re-partitioning
this weekend i'm finally be able to go online and to read all my mails,
 oh well...

now, let me introduce myself, i'm a web-programmer from germany (gmt+1)
(that makes us two now, right?), 24 years old and you can call
me stefan if you like (there so many nicks of me floating arround
in the  net, 'rosewood' is fine too...).
right now i'm self-employed and doing some jobs for a mini-game
company, mostly html and php/mysql stuff (ever heard of the
'moorhuhn'?).

i first found out about emulation in 1998, 'back then' a friend
gave me a cd w/ some snes roms and zsnes, though it just had
about 5 fps i was still amazed and couldn't wait to get a faster
pc to run the games in their full glory.
first it was only console emulation, like snes, nes, genesis, gb/c,
and then came the neo-geo to invite me in the world of arcade emulation.
i didn't like mame very much back then so i had to play w/ neoragex.
then came the first neogeocd emu and the iso trading sites, for some
time i was member of 'neogeo team 2000' and 'neogeonocide' and was
maintaining the cd-cover sections there (those sites are still alive).
later then came finalburn and the cps-2 hype and romcenter, finally
a tool to keep track of all the collected roms...

at that time i thought it would be cool to have a complete database
w/ every game ever released, but logiqx allredy had invented caesar,
i didn't want to interfere/compete w/ that database back then, but
then logiqx/pi were asking for help, and here i am, willing to give
something back to emulation community!!!

@logiqx, regarding 'IMPORTANT, please READ and RESPOND':
about the role:
'apprentice' = yes, i'm always learning...
'dat packager' = yes, i think i can handle that, complexity = 1-2
'uploader' = yes of course, i'm living in the web... ;-)
--
i could create a database-driven site for the team to reflect everything
that has been done and is to be done to the dat files, tell me what you
think about that ...

@pi:
'rosewoodj' is not intended to be 1337 (who is 1377 anway? ;-)), the
'j' is just there because rosewood was taken allready, what about
the @logiqx.com address? :-)

That is an interesting idea but I think that once we are up to date with
everything there won't be too much need for it (there should only ever be a
small handful of things outstanding at most). I'll ceratinly keep it in the
back of my mind though. :)

> the @logiqx.com address? :-)

Getting such things set up is a real pain. Expect a month's worth of
reminder e-mails to the ZTnet admins before that happens! Once it is
apparent who is going to stick with the team, we'll certainly go about
getting them set up but it is too much trouble when I don't know who will
stay for sure. An example of their speed is that I've still not had a reply
to my request for teamlogiqx@logiqx.com (requested a week before I asked
dave@emuverse)!

Ok, lesson 1 will be on Friday. I may write it tonight though and ask
Rosewood to sanity check it so that I can send it to the list on Friday.

Lesson 0 will be sent to the list today though, ha ha! Lesson 0 will just be
installing the pre-requisite software (i.e. selected parts of Cygwin, my
tools and the XML tool). I am packaging it all up to make it as simple as

Before we start doing the lessons proper, you will need to install a few
tools
on your PC. Please ensure you do this before you begin the lessons
themselves.

This shouldn't take more than 5 or 10 minutes. Let me know how you get on.
;)

STEP 1 - Create a 'Logiqx' directory
======

- Create a directory called 'Logiqx' on a drive that is convenient for you
  (this will probably be 'c:\' for most people).

STEP 2 - Download the tools needed
======

- Download all of the 'bin' archives from
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/

- Extract all of the archives into your 'Logiqx' directory (e.g. c:\Logiqx)

STEP 3 - Configure your path
======

Windows 95 or 98:

- Add these lines to c:\autoexec.bat

  SET LOGIQX=c:\Logiqx
  SET PATH=%PATH%;%LOGIQX%\bin

- Once you autoexec.bat is updated you will need to reboot your PC.

Windows NT, 2000 or XP (do not use c:\autoexec.bat, that is naughty, lol):

I only have Windows 2000 as reference but NT and XP are almost identical...

- From the Start Menu, select 'Settings->Control Panel'
- Double-click the 'System' icon

- Select the 'Advanced' sheet (on Windows 2000, called 'Environment' on NT)
- Click on 'Environment Variables...'

- Click on 'New...' (under the 'System variables' section)
- Specify a variable name of 'LOGIQX' and value of 'c:\Logiqx'

- Select 'Path' (under the 'System variables' section)
- Click 'Edit...'
- Add ';%LOGIQX%\bin' at the end of the value line and press 'OK'

On NT/2000/XP there is no need for a reboot (if you followed my steps
above).

STEP 4 - Test it works!
======

- Open a command prompt (what some people call a 'DOS window')

- Execute 'echo %LOGIQX%'. This should show something like 'c:\Logiqx'.

- Execute 'path'. This should show 'c:\Logiqx\bin' at the end of the line.

- Execute 'ls -l'. This should show a Unix directory listing.

If everything worked as expected then you have done everything right. :)

Please go there to see what's available, including a new digest

The digest will be updated every once in a while and then broken

Also I tried to keep track with the team list, but I'm sure I'm
missing things. Everyone please check your line there and if you

Does anyone else have XP? XP may well be the cause of Rob's problem but I
have no machine with XP installed.

Rob, in the meantime just specify e:\logiqx\bin in your path (rather than
using the %LOGIQX% variable).

i'm using xp here, everything is running fine...

rob, can you run the 'ls' command from your %LOGIQX%\bin directory?
maybe you just extracted the tools to the wrong directory...

The problem is in command 2 (not in 3), the path should be:

PATH=C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;e:\Logiqx\bin

instead of:

PATH=C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;%LOGIQX%\bin

I have Windows XP too and it work fine, know i'll try to reproduce this
error myself and will see !

Yup, works now.  The question is why?  My _guess_ is some kinda wacky NT/2K
vs. 9X hybridization thing...

Talk to you soon,

I'm using XP Pro SP1.

Extract was OK.  It didn't work until after Mike's fix (...;e:\logiqx\bin).
Again, why?

Yet command 1 worked fine...
XP obviously recognizes the system variable, yet won't substitute it into
the path.  Hmm....
Did you try "...;%LOGIQX%\bin" or "...;e:\Logiqx\bin" or both?

Talk to you soon,

i'm using xp sp1 (1106) too, and i tried '%LOGIQX%\bin',
just checked the settings, xp translated my path
variable to 'x:\logiqx\bin' after restart...

btw, the current user and system both have their own path variable,
the length shouldn't extend 512 (?) chars!

another possibility, does this have something to do w/ the
admin rights?
