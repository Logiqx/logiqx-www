Multi stands for "multiple game emulator". Systems have nothing to do with
this. And in many cases it's *hard* to decide where a game system ends and
where not. When we were building CAESAR, there was some talking about how
to explicitly define which emus were multi and which ones were not. In the
end we (he) decided that if an emulator supported games in different MAME
sets, it was multi. So an emu for Pacman and Ms.Pacman would be "multi",
whereas one emu.
(Ok he decided that but the idea was mine to polish is already existing
organization scheme. I did not do too much for CAESAR but I put my grain of
sand)

The Single folder is for emus which only support games in the same set
(that set being defined as MAME says, regardless of the hardware). The
System folder is for games in the same system, regardless of which emulator
support the games. You will even see some non-supported games in them
(unxored cps2 for example).

Think of it as in MAME games: there is one "name" like sdgndmps and then a
"description" like "SD Gundam Psycho Salamander no Kyoui" (I loved this
example!) In this case, the name would be viva_nonno (identifier for RC2
headers and CAESAR), and the description would be "Viva Nonno". Since not
even in the official site the space is clear, maybe Mike made a little
mistake. If he discovers that it makes you impossible to audit your roms,
I'm sure he will fix it :) If not, well, will be fixed in next update LOL

If the game is undumped, then the CRC will be null (0x00000000). If it's
dumped, then somehow the CRC's will be known and hence could be included in
the dat correctly. I am not sure if this game is released, but probably
it's dumped since VN supports it. Another thing is that you or me can find
the roms, maybe they are being hoarded.

> (Note: this is NOT a rom request in any form! it's a delicate subject,

Well we've not talked about these. But if you do a datfile, you are
supossed to test it. How? auditing your own romsets! For that you will need
roms. Now there is no solution for that but I'm sure somehow in not a very
far future we will have this problem solved ;)

> I think in some ways the team does have the rights to keep the roms

No morality discussion here, sorry. For that, go to your local lawyer or
talk to your priest. Or whatever you have :)

Hello people

Well Logiqx is out, will not come back in 9-10 days, so BEHAVE.

I simply *can't* solve all your doubts about all this datfile
mess, but I will answer when I know what to answer. So everyone
has plenty of lessons to read and exercises to practice, you can
redo the dats Logiqx did and see if they are different.

Don't worry about what is going to come or not, just stick with
what's already explained by Logiqx. People with troubles PLEASE
post your doubts in the list, and people who has passed
successfully the lessons, PLEASE help them.

As for me, I'm WAY behind maintaining the team page. I've updated
the index a bit (there is IMPORTANT information in it). I will
post there the remaining lessons since some people seem to have
had probs with the list lately. I'll post also the digests,
finally. The thign is that right now I'm going out, so I'll do it
during the weekend.
And don't forget to visit me at CAESAR!!! (shit now I realize I
forgot to put that link in the site, damn me!)

So basically "holidays" until Datman Returns. Anyone wants me to
explain how to start a good pic collection like I did with Chloe
Jones? :)

there is a dumped S22 rom (victlap) not supported by VivaNonno

Well probably Mike would like something more like "Namco System 2x",
grouping the same batch of hardware, you know. But I know he will not do it,
and actually I'd bet that he would put it as exercise: "creating a system
dat from emulator dats" or something.

To Leslaw:

The only l33t things Logiqx gets is the CPS2 data before XOR releases, and
that's like some hours before the releases so he can prepare the datfile. I
don't think Logiqx gets anything else which other persons don't get.

You're right, we don't have any rights, legal or moral, over the roms. BUT
something inside us tells us that it's not bad to have the PacMan roms, and
play the game. We feel like it's even something positive, even when legally
and morally speaking we know it's not 100% right. But in fact, anything we
say to convince us that it's right are just excuses.

In my case, where the PacMan case is clear, it's not so clear about KOF2000.
Maybe about KOF94, or even KOF96, but not about 2k... Strange, uh? Not many
people say they don't agree with the 2-year delay in mame, cause it's SHORT
hahahahah (Vincent Price's evil laugh)

This is not a morality discussion, each one is free to think what he wants,
as long as it doesn't open the ozone hole again... :)



To Dr. Zero:

You can't. The amount of messages and text I can write on a day is by far
much more than you would be able to read in one week. When Logiqx comes
back, ask him if I do write many emails... It's just that lately I'm in low
shape. But still you can't make me crazy with questions. I'm already crazy

Well you will be surprised, Logiqx can have some good ideas, I mean the
kind of ideas which build up books, you know? I think he will say something
similar to me, which is: Legally, having roms is illegal, and morally, it
shouldn't be illegal.
What I don't agree is the timeline. For MAME, it's 2 years. For me, it
should be *at least* five years. There are very few people who think that
the 2 years limit is also not enough... But well, those are details.

I'll have to place a link for the Emulation FAQ, which is a case study
about the legality of emulation and all related activities. It's one of the
most interesting pieces of information about emulation I've ever read, and
it's still a great piece related to legality of emulation. Tho it's a bit
heavy and long, it gives an historical perspective to the emulation world
that no other paper or "hey we've emulated sys22" has done. Not all of you
will read it, but well, for me it's a must for real emulation lovers.
Recently I also posted in CAESAR a link about an article in MobyGames
regarding legality and abandonware, which pretty much fits with the roms
subject, I'll try to find it.

Happy birthday Stefan! You know, there is a tradition in Team Logiqx (well
a tradition which has just started NOW) that when a member has his
birthday, he has to tell us the story of his nick.

Potentially but I think it unlikely. The reason I create system dats is
because many emulators support the systems (including all of the sound
emulators like QPlayer, QSound Player, NeoJukebox etc). Currently there is
only one S22 emulator so I think that a dat is overkill. ;)

The CRCs for the unavailable sets came from the readme be the author. In
such circumstances this is the only thing that we can go on.

My advice is just to keep quiet in public and if you have ROMs then not to
mention them, via e-mail or forum. The dats and CAESAR are in my opinion a
huge contribution towards documenting gaming history but that doesn't give
us any right to hold other peoples copyrighted material. Of course, having
them doesn't harm anyone financially, so long as we don't spread them widely
(plenty of other sites seem to enjoy taking that risk). ;)

I don't think that any game company is hugely worried about old games
(except if they sell ports or emulators themselves) but when it starts
impacting current game takings then they will take notice. This is why I
agree with emulator authors not doing really new stuff on CPS-2 and Neo-Geo.

Well it seems that KOF 2002 MVS version has been released and I don't see
any
rom kiddiez on the NG board whining about if it has been dumped. There was
not
too much hype about Rage of the Dragons. I think the rom kiddiez were
dissapointed by bad sequels like KOF2001 and Metal Slug 4 and changed to the
ISOz sk3n3. Hopefully I'm right and they're all gone :)

hm NeoGeo is a different story in my oppionion, it's not SNK
anymore, all the glory is gone... Eolith did a good job in
reviving the old system, even though they were aware of the
almost perfect emulation (raster effects still aren't complete,
right?). Maybe they should've concentrated on the NeoGeo64...
I personally like MS4, it's like the prequels, everytime I
play it, I find something new in the games :)

about the emu kidz, I wonder why Emuchina shut down the English
site and bbs...

  > About CPS2, really emu authors have NOTHING to do ;)

that's the big Raz story ---
although I doubt that he has dumped/ha-xored the 2001/02 pcbs ...

I'm just collecting roms for my own personal enjoyment,
never intended to spread them to the whole world...

Roms should be free because...
Programmers are artists in their own way, so every piece of
software (even WindowsXP or MacOS X) is considered to be a
piece of art and to be made available to the public for free
or a minimal fee.
Roms are art too (NeoGeo or CPS2 games are pure art)...

btw, are there any Open-Source or PD arcade games (except
NeoNoPon) yet?

Hi,

I've looked over them and they were pretty much perfect (uploaded to
logiqx.com too).

The only thing to mention is that filenames containing spaces need to use
%20 in the XML (for the HTML). If you don't do this then Netscape users
start complaining about broken links, hehe.

p.s. Also changed dates to today, since they have been waiting for upload so

De: "Logiqx" <logiqx@logiqx.com>
Responder a: teamlogiqx@emuverse.com
A: <teamlogiqx@emuverse.com>

I have just updated 3 more dats for logiqx.com (FBA, Daphne, RAINE) and made
some improvements to 'Dats' and 'Dats_RC' at the same time.

1) I have created sub-directories for files that relate to a particular
version of each emulator. For example: mame.exe, fba.exe, Nebula drivers,
etc. See the attached PNG for an illustration. Files within these
directories are either used for automatic dat generation, to verify newly
created dats or identify ROM changes in an emulator (all actions are
scripted so that you can see what is possible). Old directories can be
deleted when a new version of the emulator comes out.

2) All scripts have been renamed to have a '_' at the beginning of them.
With more dats being added to the environment it makes it easier to find the
script when it is above all other files. ;)

3) The makefiles now hide the output of DatUtil and MAMEDiff. Instead, they
just output a simple message to say what is going on. Much easier on the
eyes! :)

4) The makefiles in 'Dats_RC' are better written, using the 'subst' function
to reduce the amount of times that each filename is included. This will make
'copy and pasting' much simpler.

5) I have created a script called '_check_merging.bat' (re-download
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/tools-logiqx.zip) so that you can use
it. This script does a datutil 'fix merging' (-m option) and compares it
with the original dat. If there is a difference then it is shown so that we
can correct our master dat. This highlighted problems a few minor problems
that I have now corrected:

- In Viva Nonno I forgot to compliment a CRC of a bad ROM (I complimented it
in the parent but not in the clone).
- In Daphne one of the 'merge' names was incorrect.
- In MAME, there were a few ROMs that weren't completely fixed. Basically,
you need to do a 'fix merging' twice to guarantee that everything is fixed.
I'll explain why later! Anyway, I have changed the MAME makefile to do two
fix merges.

Finally, because of the changes you should delete your 'Dats' and 'Dats_RC'
directories (back them up if you wish) and redownload these:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats.zip
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats_RC.zip

They include the three new dats (so that you can see what I have done) and
preliminary areas for Laser, Calice and Mimic. Currently these areas just
contain comparison scripts so that we can see what is new in the meulators
but they will be interesting for you to look at.

Got to go out now and won't have access to my e-mail until tomorrow. I am
sure you will manage ok without me though. ;)

De: "Logiqx" <logiqx@logiqx.com>

Hi everyone, a few things to mention today.

1) As you may have noticed on the logiqx.com site, I've updated a few more
dats.

Most of these address problems that '_check_merging.bat' reported (I have
now checked every single dat for merge problems). ACE is the only genuine
dat update (added sgemf).

2) There is a new '_check_merging.sh' that shows CRC conflicts too (needed
for Calice). You can get it by re-downloading:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/tools-logiqx.zip

3) I have improved the dat makefiles after considering Stefan's comments:

>I noticed some spelling differences, e.g. in the rebuild_all.mak
>first it is "Viva Nonno" (= "Viva?Nonno"), then in line #8 it is
>spelled "viva_nonno"; in the WWW folder it's spelled "VivaNonno"
>and inside the dat files again "Viva Nonno xxxxx".

The lower-case reference (e.g. viva_nonno) is no longer used. Instead, it
uses a name that matches the rest of the makefile rules (i.e. Viva?Nonno).

We are left with just 3 variants now but that is for good reason:

Viva Nonno - The 'human' name for dat files, ZIPs etc
Viva?Nonno - The question mark is required within makefile rules
VivaNonno - The XML entity name (website directory corresponds for
consistency). Reason, XML identifiers can not have space in them.

So, we are now as consistent as we can be considering we use 3 different
technologies (regular files for humans, makefile rules, XML entities). ;)

4) I updated all makefiles that simply 'cp' (i.e. copy) dats or txt files,
now they all use the 'subst' trick. This is much better than before, imho.

5) U64Emu is now officially 'old', lol.

6) For the latest Dats/Dats_RC and WWW directories, use these links:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats.zip
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/Dats_RC.zip
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/WWW.zip

After a while I am sure that these wholesale changes will cease and we can
start distributing individual directories for each emulator. ;)

7) I made a start (and almost finished) the Calice dat, just
mslug4/mslug4n/kof2001 to add (when we have figured out the correct dump to
use).

Calice is a manually-intensive dat! You will see in the latest 'Dats'
directory (download from URL above) that there is a comparison script for
Calice that can compare the drivers in two Calice releases and the latest
dat against the latest driver. Using this I was able to see which games were
added (or changed) then look at the Calice drivers to figure out which dump
is really required (he doesn't always use the right ZIP name). David has a
habit of getting ZIP names and ROM names incorrect so after copying a game
from the CPS-2 dat I checked every single ROM name and corrected it in my
dat where Calice uses the wrong name. Incorrect ROM names cause many CRC
conflicts (shown by '_check_merging.bat/.sh') but these are unavoidable.
Calice doesn't load by CRC so it is better for us to have conflicts in the
dat and let the ROM managers sort out the mess. At least by using the names
he desires (albeit with conlicts), out comparison scripts don't show any
errors in our dat. ;)

Tonight I don't plan on doing any computer-based work other than:

- Packaging the remaining resources and uploading to logiqx.com.
- Updating CAESAR for the emulators that we have recently released dats for.
- Updating my resource collections.
- Updating my Dad's website.

That lot will probably take a couple of hours, so afterwards I will just
relax for the rest of the evening! Maybe do the shopping and tidy up the
house too. ;)

I can see that a few of you have been following the lessons and have a
working environment set up (stefan/rosewood, rob, leslaw/sla,
andrea/dr.zero). Has anyone else been successfully following the lessons?

I have updated the web copies (http://www.logiqx.com/team/) to look a bit
prettier and also include the changes that were made as we went along.
Anyone who hasn't followed the lessons yet but wishes to do so should
therefore use the web versions since they are easier to read and don't
reference things that no longer matter.

I have now added all of the remaining dats into our environment. :)

I also made updates to CPS-1, Neo-Geo, Nebula Jukebox, NeoJukeBox and
QPlayer. These are all available in the big ZIPs at
http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/ (currently uploading, slowly for some
reason).

There are only 3 dats that need updates now! CottAGE, Laser and Mimic. Once
I have done these we will have everything in place for people to try any dat
they feel like the next time an emulator is updated. :)

I did want to explain these updates in a lesson tonight but due to the fact
I was in a traffic jam coming back from work I only have a few seconds
remaining before I must leave the house again! Basically the system dats are
built from part of the MAME dat and the sound dats for systems are
maintained by hand (cross checked by scanning a full system set). The sound
emulator dats are built from the sound systems dats (fully automatic). I'll
explain it properly another day!

I have made the first draft for Mimic and Laser but I want to test them
properly (i.e. load every game).

If anyone fancies doing the task then it would be most appreciated. Attached
are CMPro dats to build the sets for testing.

I know a few games definitely won't work in Laser (earthinv, superinv,
beaminv and ozmawar2) but there may be some other games where I have got the
name incorrect or the ROM names incorrect (this is the purpose of testing
;) ). This is wholy expected so I have provided src.zip that contains
information about correct names. The actual  ROM sizes and CRCs should all
be correct though. Examples of things that may be incorrect are games like
invaders1 which I have probably got wrong; it should be in a directory
called 'invadersl' (i.e. in the dat) but run using the name 'invaders1'.

Mimic is also a bit of a pain. It hangs on my Win2K P4 machine and only just
runs on my P233 Win98. I have to test games by loading them and if they
start I know the dat is correct, then ctrl-alt-delete to kill the emulator
and load the next game!

These dats have not been tested by me at all yet so I fully expect a few
problems to be found. ;)

Mike

p.s. a list of all games to test in Laser is included in src.zip (driver.c)

Second, i need to separate my "work" email (= this one) from the Team

How to do that? How to change email to which the post will go?

I have done some automated checks of the dat now (against the drivers) and
created a batch script to run each game in Laser32, one after the other. If
someone feels like testing the dat (i.e. running all 78 games in laser),
then please use the new dat attached and the batch script provided. I don't
thnik it will take more than 15 minutes (just press the escape key to exit
each game). Only 3 games are expected to fail; earthinv, superniv, ozmawar2
(see comments in the dat file). I don't yet know the ROMs for beaminv either
(not searched for them yet).

there's an error in the batch file (you did search'n'replace of
laser/laser32, right?)!
laser32 spclaser32 -> laser32 spclaser
laser32 laser32 -> laser32 laser

all the games except the 3 you mentioned will start up, some are
playable,
some are not, some show just a black screen and most of them look like
crap!

tell me if you want further details of which games are actually
playable.

Never too late. Extra testing is always good but I decided I wanted to
release early tonight. I have an annoying habit of doing things like that...

I have just put together a little page which will be very useful to us as a
team (until now this information has only been in my head). The various
makefiles know the dependencies for automatic dat generation but it is also
necessary to know what dats can be affected by changing another one, plus
the manual tasks that are required as a result. This information is shown at
the URL below:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/depend.txt

As you can see, there are lots of things affected by a MAME update so
hopefully we can share them out at the time of the next MAME release.
Automatic dat updates simply need checking (to see if anything has really
changed) whereas semi-automatic and manual updates need checking by hand
(and updating if necessary). In anticipation of this, it may be an idea to
have a glance at the makefiles so that you understand how everything is
done. If you have any questions then feel free to ask and I will answer
them.

Hi Mike,

-U64emu
it it necessary to include the disk images in the datfile?
I tested the images I had for ages on my hd and they are marked
as 'unknown', either because I converted them w/ nekkid.exe or
because they are actual hd images, so they could be changed by
the emu (don't know about that for sure).
...and it takes ages to load those big files in RomCenter :(

-Laser
the 3 built-in games 'hockeytv', 'pong' and 'pongdbls' are marked
as missing / NO_ROMS in RomCenter, is there a way arround this?
I think it will confuse some people...

There were lots of discussions at the time of U64Emu2 and the final the
decision was to create the dat as currently stands. You need to do a factory
restore within the emulator and then ZIP up the resultant hard disk for
scanning and archiving (the readme with the data file explains in detail).
Scanning a big ZIP file should not be slow in RomCenter but scanning a big
non-zipped file will be very slow. I don't use RomCenter though.

>-Laser

I think we are stuck with this, it's a shortfalling of the RomCenter file
format (combining game details and ROM details on all lines). CMPro is fine
(it just misses the games) but I need them for the benefit of CAESAR. I
prefer not to get into the business of having different dats for the ROM
managers and CAESAR though because I just forget after a while. ;)

Hi everyone,

There are a few dats that need updating so if anyone would like to try their
hand then now would be a great opportunity. The team page lists what needs
updating but I will mention them all here:

- CottAGE needs a big update. If I were to do it myself I might be tempted
to start again from scratch, using the MAME dat to copy from (only using the
CottAGE dat as reference if there are some non-MAME standard ROMs used).

- Daphne needs a check performing to see if DLE 2.0 is a new ROM (or
replaces an earlier one).

- Mimic needs one game adding and another one uses one less ROM if I
remember correctly. The script needed to compare two Mimic releases is
available in Dats.tar.gz.

- Nebula has some SF2 hacks to add:

> Street Fighter 2 M-1 (Not Working, used t [name: sf2m-1 - parent: sf2ce]
> Street Fighter 2 M-2 (Gfx problems) [name: sf2m-2 - parent: sf2ce]
> Street Fighter 2 M-3 (Not Working) [name: sf2m-3 - parent: sf2ce]
> Street Fighter 2 M-4 [name: sf2m-4 - parent: sf2ce]
> Street Fighter 2 M-5 [name: sf2m-5 - parent: sf2ce]
> Street Fighter 2 M-6 [name: sf2m-6 - parent: sf2ce]
> Street Fighter 2 M-7 [name: sf2m-7 - parent: sf2ce]

- Finally, I would like to check that no changes were in Final Burn that
Dave forgot about. ;)

Any takers?

Hi!

I built the Finalburn set with one exception, "Royal Ascot 2"
(royalascot2),
couldn't find this romset anywhere, if somebody would be so kind to tell
me
where to find it?

all games load and play fine, except "Strider Hiryu (Japan set 1)"
(striderj),
FB is looking for the only rom sthj23.bin in the parent (strider)!

I will create a new dat for FB, but first I need to find the missing
game...

Also, if nobody else wants it, I'd like to try the Nebula dat, it's a
bit
harder to do I think, probably I'll do it this weekend.

Hi Dr.Zer0,

did you try to use a download manager/accelerator (like FlashGet,

it'll resume your stopped downloads...

if everything else fails, tell me what files you need, I'll put them on my

It won't stay there long and of course the URL can't be shared with anyone

Don't go to the effort of a complete rewrite though Stephan, just use
MAMEDiff to compare the generated data file of the last version and the
current version (can use the _compare_versions.bat script in the Final Burn
dir). Any differences should be incorporated into the existing dat (maybe
that's what you meant though). ;)

>FB is looking for the only rom sthj23.bin in the parent (strider)!

Doh, can you drop Dave a mail on this please (he obviously doesn't specify
two possible ZIP names for striderj ROMs)? Mention that you work with me and
he should be helpful since we know each other. In terms of the dat, sadly
there is no way to force this behaviour without putting that ROM in the
parent set. However, I don't really want to do that since it messes up the
information in CAESAR. Best to just put a comment above striderj in the
CMPro copy (I just use hashes - see Laser release as an example). I know the
game can't then be built in a working state but it makes life easier for
CAESAR (and doesn't cause annoying warnings about ROM mismatches to me).

I have a tip for Nebula. Build CPS-1, CPS-2, Neo-Geo, PGM and Konami into
different ROM paths for a nice organised collection. This is easiestly
achieved by first building yourself ROM sets for the system dats I produce
and then re-building one system at a time to your Nebula directories. A
second tip is when validating the ROMs within Nebula, select one system at a
time when reading the game list to see that all are green (for less to
scroll through). For supplement ROM sets, I just use one directory for the
emulator (which is supplementary to my two MAME directories - MAME/standard
and MAME/Neo-Geo).

Hmm, I may try Raiden at home then (instead of WarFTP that I currently use).
However, there is an old saying about not fiddling with something that

Cool. I helped him out with implementing ZIP support a while ago but never
had the time to help him with stability issues (just reported them).
Personally I think he should ditch DJGPP and compile with MinGW. ;)

Hi!

just some small notes about the team page:

when I look at the Members page, there is almost
no difference between the yellow and green cells
in my eyes (a minor color-weakness), can you change
that into some darker notes of the colors?
And as noted before, my age should be 25 now ;)

There is also a security issue, when the people
out there in the world get to know about the
team activity, there will be somebody trying
different combinations to access the team page
(i would do that ;-), www.logiqx.com/team/
isn't too hard to figure out...

Maybe we should use a password protection there
(via .htaccess file for example)?

I have the same problem, I hope the new colors are readable,
maybe too strong colors for background but now I can distinguish
the green and yellow :) I had to change by text replacing rather
than by HTML editing, I didn't know which ones were the green!

That color weakness might have the same root as mine. Have you
ever had a daltonism test? It is some papers with lots of small
circles of different colors, the different circles form numbers
and you only have to say which number is. I remember I only got
the first one right, the rest were just noise for me.

> And as noted before, my age should be 25 now ;)

Fixed, my fault.

that's much better now, thx a lot!
the green is awesome, it jumps right into my face and tries to
pull my eyes out ;-)

yeah, it's a hereditary disease, but it's the girls' fault because
the particulary part of the DNA that causes this weakness is transported
by the girls only!

I can't remember to have a number weakness too :P

Hello!

about the FinalBurn dat I'd say we leave it as it is right now and wait
for the next emu update, if any...
Reasons:
- the error about the Strider Hiryu set has been there for about
  a half year or longer and nobody complained yet (I checked it with
v0.517)
- Dave hasn't been much help yet
  <quote>
    I think i just decided that for one file it really wasnt worth

  </quote>

Nebula: I'm still building the whole set, 2+ GB hd space waste,
ClrMamePro
is a real pain and RomCenter sometimes isn't accurate enough...
isn't there a way to tell either rommanager "copy all neogeo sets from
the
mame folder to the neogeo folder" ?

Leslaw, you were asking for work too, so let's make a kind of
competition
out of this and you do the Nebula dat too...

I'll try to figure this out, even if it takes me the whole weekend!

I am not completely sure if the servers use Apache but I would imagine so.
If you want to provide a suitable .htaccess file then either Pi or myself
can upload it for a try.

Yes, I know the feeling. ;)

I have MAME, Final Burn, FBA, Nebula, Kawaks, Calice, ACE,
CPS-1/CPS-2/Neo-Geo on my HD and it is very full with duplication of CPS-2
and Neo-Geo games. I need a new disk thinking about it!

Multiple people doing the same work is a good idea. It allows more people to
do updates for a given emulator and will also be a good means of checking
each other's work in the early days. :)

I'll check everything too but after a while I'm sure that will become
unnecessary.

De: "Ben Jos Walbeehm" <walbeehm@walbeehm.com>
Responder a: teamlogiqx@emuverse.com
Organización: WinnieWorks
A: <teamlogiqx@emuverse.com>

Hi all,

Logiqx (or do you prefer Mike?) asked me to write a little introduction
about
myself, so here goes:

My name is Ben Jos Walbeehm. "Ben Jos" is my first name. "Jos" is more or
less
pronounced like the word "yoss" would be pronounced in English. I am 36
years
old and I live in Tampa, Florida, USA. My timezone is EST/EDT (GMT -5:00). I
was born and raised in the Netherlands and moved to the US about 7.5 years
ago. I'm still a Dutch citizen. I am divorced and have a beautiful 3 year
old
daughter who lives with my ex-wife.

I hold a Master's degree in Computing Science and another Master's degree in
Psychology. My job title is "Sr. Software Engineer". I used to be a game
programmer, but most of the games that have my name related to them are not
very exciting: A dozen or so Barbie games.

I have a habit of writing lots of little programs for myself to make my life
easier. I have created a few .dat files for myself in the past, some of
which
I wrote little programs for first to help me. My main hobby is cmoputers. I
spend just about every waking moment on a computer. Things I do on the
computer vary from talking on IRC to writing programs to reading things that
interest me on the web to playing games and lots and lots of other things.
Until very recently, I played a LOT of Unreal Tournament. There's a handful
of
games I play in MAME (older games) and I don't use any other emulators,
although I have a complete set for a lot of them. It's like an addiction for
me to have complete sets, even though I never use most of them.

Using Roman Scherzer's ZipMax program (to which I made some small
contributions) and using 40 different configurations, I've minimised all my
.zip files as much as possible. I have created a database that for each ROM
I
have contains basically just the raw, compressed, (ZipMaxed) data. I've
written some tools to easily maintain my database and also the external
zipfiles, so that I am not swamped with duplicates. I've also written a
program that allows me to very quickly build a ROM set from any ClrMame Pro
compatible .dat file. Since it uses my database, it does not have to do any
compression or decompression; it just takes the correct raw compressed
files,
puts headers and such on them, and creates valid .zip files that way. That
way, it can create complete sets, even large ones, in a matter of a few
minutes or less.

I don't have much I do besides being on a computer, although, every now and
then, I buy a dozen or so Science Fiction books and those manage to keep me
mostly away from my computers. I then spend just about every waking moment
reading (and also when I really should be sleeping) until I've read them all
and then it's back to computers again. I also like listening to (mostly) 80s
music while on the computer.

I never had much imagination when it came to choosing a nick, so when I got
on
IRC, 8 years ago or so, I simply used my first name as a nick. Since IRC
nicks
can't have spaces in them, I made it "Ben_Jos", but changed that a few days
later to "BenJos" because everyone kept calling me "Ben" (and I hate being
called that) and I hoped that making it "BenJos" would stop people from
calling me "Ben". Well, it didn't help much... . At least regulars in my
regular channels knew/know not to call me "Ben".

I'll leave it at this for now. Is anyone still awake? :-)

Welcome to the team Ben Jos. Just call me Mike, I only use my nick in
public.

Your database idea is very cool! It sounds like a great idea in light of all
the emulators that support CPS-x and Neo-Geo.

Hello Mike,

after some trouble with the autogenerated datfile
(the 'Version' in the header should be 'version' so
datutil can work with it), I can finally go further..

I have a question regarding those new SF2M-x hacks,
the author of Nebula declared the required roms like this:

        name sf2m-1
        description "Street Fighter 2 M-1 (Not Working, used to work)"
        cloneof sf2ce
        romof sf2ce
        rom ( name 222e size 524288 crc 1E20D0A3 )
        rom ( name 196e size 524288 crc 88CC38A3 )
        rom ( name s92_21a.bin merge s92_21a.bin size 524288 crc
925A7877 )
        rom ( name sf2.09 merge s92_09.bin size 65536 crc 08F6B60E )
        rom ( name sf2.18 merge s92_18.bin size 131072 crc 7F162009 )
        rom ( name sf2.19 merge s92_19.bin size 131072 crc BEADE53F )
        rom ( name sf2.01 merge s92_01.bin size 524288 crc 03B0D852 )
        rom ( name sf2.03 merge s92_02.bin size 524288 crc 840289EC )
        rom ( name sf2.02 merge s92_03.bin size 524288 crc CDB5F027 )
        rom ( name sf2.04 merge s92_04.bin size 524288 crc E2799472 )
        rom ( name sf2.05 merge s92_05.bin size 524288 crc BA8A2761 )
        rom ( name sf2.07 merge s92_06.bin size 524288 crc E584BFB5 )
        rom ( name sf2.06 merge s92_07.bin size 524288 crc 21E3F87D )
        rom ( name sf2.08 merge s92_08.bin size 524288 crc BEFC47DF )
        rom ( name sf2.10 merge s92_10.bin size 524288 crc 960687D5 )
        rom ( name sf2.12 merge s92_11.bin size 524288 crc 978ECD18 )
        rom ( name sf2.11 merge s92_12.bin size 524288 crc D6EC9A0A )
        rom ( name sf2.13 merge s92_13.bin size 524288 crc ED2C67F6 )

why did he use names like "sf2.xx" instead of "s92_xx.bin" ?
Nebula identifies those roms via CRC anyway and doesn't look at the
names.
shouln't it be something like that:

        name sf2m-1
        description "Street Fighter 2 M-1 (Not Working, used to work)"
        cloneof sf2ce
        romof sf2ce
        rom ( name 222e size 524288 crc 1E20D0A3 )
        rom ( name 196e size 524288 crc 88CC38A3 )
        rom ( name s92_21a.bin merge s92_21a.bin size 524288 crc
925A7877 )
        rom ( name s92_09.bin merge s92_09.bin size 65536 crc 08F6B60E )
        rom ( name s92_18.bin merge s92_18.bin size 131072 crc 7F162009
)
        rom ( name s92_19.bin merge s92_19.bin size 131072 crc BEADE53F
)
        rom ( name s92_01.bin merge s92_01.bin size 524288 crc 03B0D852
)
        rom ( name s92_02.bin merge s92_02.bin size 524288 crc 840289EC
)
        rom ( name s92_03.bin merge s92_03.bin size 524288 crc CDB5F027
)
        rom ( name s92_04.bin merge s92_04.bin size 524288 crc E2799472
)
        rom ( name s92_05.bin merge s92_05.bin size 524288 crc BA8A2761
)
        rom ( name s92_06.bin merge s92_06.bin size 524288 crc E584BFB5
)
        rom ( name s92_07.bin merge s92_07.bin size 524288 crc 21E3F87D
)
        rom ( name s92_08.bin merge s92_08.bin size 524288 crc BEFC47DF

)
        rom ( name s92_13.bin merge s92_13.bin size 524288 crc ED2C67F6
)

and about the other hacks (m-2 - m-7), the CRCs for all new roms are
right
now declared as unknown (00000000), can I use the CRCs of the roms
available
now or is there a possibility of new dumps appearing soon?

btw, there are some new hacks of Warriors of Fate,
http://www.cemucg.net/main/download.asp?id=202, do they belong in the
official Logiqx datfile or do I have to release an unofficial dat for
example?

When ROMs can be merged, the emulator author should use the ROM names from
the parent. In the case of the new hacks, it seems that only a couple of
program ROMs are different from the original so all of the other ROMs adopt
sf2ce names.

If you have sets that appear to be the games added to Nebula then you should
use those CRCs. Sometimes we get to know the CRCs because the author
includes them in the emulator but other times we have to just take the ones
we find. I am pretty certain that any ROMs you find for the new hacks
(assuming they have the correct ZIP and ROM names) will be the ones that
Nebula expects.

When it comes to my system dat for CPS-1, I only add hacks that are
supported by any of the emulators (Nebula, Kawaks, FBA). Until it is added,
just ignore it because trying to follow all of the hacks is a fairly
pointless exercise (unless we need them in our official emulator dats). ;)

When I get a chance, I will have to re-apply my fixes to his drivers so that
a dat can be created without naming conflicts and validates 100% against the
Nebula drivers (my fixed drivers that is). Ben Jos, you will like the way
that DatUtil and MAMEDiff can validate a dat for Nebula against the drivers
themselves. :)

Hope that helps, Mike

I'm still confused, the roms in the parent sf2ce have the prefix
"S92" while the roms in the game sf2 have the prefix "sf2".
when the M hacks are clones of the sf2ce game, why don't they
follow the prefix of the parent?

only the CRCs of the first hack were included in the emulator dat,
since all other hacks I found on Emuchina are playable in a way
I assume that these are the correct CRCs.

ok, maybe they're in the next release of Nebula...

sf2 and sf2ce are unrelated in parent/clone terms so the names should not be
compared.

They should follow the parent prefix (that's what ElSemi has done) but I
don't know what the dumpers have done. I have not downloaded the ROMs yet.

Yes, that's what I was saying. ;)

I have re-applied my fixes to his drivers. An entire Nebula directory for
your Logiqx dat area is available at:

ftp://leslaw:leslaw@149.156.75.202:2121/TEAM_LOGIQX/Dats/Recent/Multi/Nebula
.zip

Just copy your new dat over the top and you can then use the
_verify_logiqx.bat script. After running _rebuild_all.bat, don't forget the
_verify_roms.bat script is handy too. :)

Gotta go, late again!

Okay, I should have looked at the drivers! Sorry I have been very busy
today...

ElSemi has the names wrong so I suggest you fix the driver and base your dat
on your fixed version (as you say, it will work in the emu due to loading by
CRC). I can send ElSemi the fixed driver when you are done (or you could do
it directly). At the same time, the missing CRCs could be added.

Mike

Yes... I made a Nebula .dat for the then-current version of Nebula a few
months ago. I learnt to hate Nebula then. :-)  The RC .dat that Nebula
itself
creates is not correct (or certainly not complete, at least) and the
information in Nebula's drivers didn't seem to be fully correct either. For
one, they do not list the ROMs needed from "resources" such as neogeo.zip.
And
even after writing and using several programs to merge and validate the
information from those sources and and older .dat file, it was still a lot
of
work. I think I tried DatUtil at some point to make my "Nebula life" easier,
but, unless I missed something, it could only do one driver at a time.

The only good thing was that Nebula loads by CRC, so I could rename some of
the ROMs to fix the conflicts ClrMame Pro would otherwise report, without
breaking Nebula's loading and running the games.

When a new Nebula was released shortly after I had finished that .dat, I
considered writing something that would create a new .dat based on the old
.dat, and the changes it found between the old drivers and the new drivers,
but I never got around to doing that. If only ElSemi simply fixed Nebula's
RC
.dat creation... :-)

Calice is the worst but Nebula comes a close second for being a pain in the
ass, lol.

I came to the conclusion that it is just a load of printf statements since
it sometimes shows ROMs not even used by the emulator (iirc). I don't use
the built in dat for anything nowadays because it can't be trusted.

> work. I think I tried DatUtil at some point to make my "Nebula life"

DatUtil can do all games at once. When you get a chance to install the
Logiqx tools and get an environment running (lessons 0, 1 and 2) then you
will be able to play with the script that I use.

Yes, that's what I've been doing and also sending fixed drivers to ElSemi.
Half the time they appear in the next release but the other half I have to
submit them again (which is a bit of a waste of my time and energy).

Sadly, emulator generated RomCenter dats are of little us. CAESAR needs the
manufacturer and year information so I always maintain CMPro dats as the
master copies. I know that they can be added in with scripting but there is
the potential for errors being introduced when game names are non-standard.

Anyway, better sign off for tonight.

Hello Logiqx,

I have also made a Nebula dat for 2.20,
I have just uploaded it to ftp.

I have used your tool to compare it to the drivers:

here are the results:

Neo-Geo Bangbead [name: bangbead]
Neo-Geo Bangbead (Prototype, unencrypted  [name: bngbeadp - parent:
bangbead]

same as before - names

Cyberbots (US 950424) [name: cybots]
(hmm - crc 00000000 in drivers???? )

Megaman 2: Power Fighters (US 960708) [name: megaman2]
Neo-Geo Sengoku 3 (Set 2) [name: sengoku3a - parent: sengoku3]
Neo-Geo Sengoku 3 (Decrypted C,console pa [name: sengoku3d - parent:
sengoku3]

same as before - names,

Street Fighter 2 M-s - no merging information and 00000000 crc
(I have used known dumps).

cps2 - bulshit as always

and

as before,

the bios name has been changed.

Let me know what do you think.

I have few questions also:

first:

How to upload?, Put only zips and .ent.xml zipped? or? or use
_upload.bat or sth?

Please explain:

>new.dat

for GAME in `grep 'name:' mamediff.2.log|sed 's/.*name: //'|sed 's/
.*//'|sed 's/].*//'`
do
        datutil -g $GAME -a new.dat "CPS-2 20020912.dat"
        datutil -g $GAME -a new.dat "Neo-Geo 20020501.dat"
done

rm -f datutil.dat datutil.log

This is great - I know what this is doing but I want to change it to
suit my needs,

explain:

for GAME in `grep 'name:' mamediff.2.log|sed 's/.*name: //'|sed 's/
.*//'|sed 's/].*//'`

somehow you ger the name (one by one) from the file, it recognizes
spaces, newlines, what is what?
