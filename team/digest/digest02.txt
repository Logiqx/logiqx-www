Hey all,

For the record, my time zone is GMT-6 during the winter and GMT-5 during the
summer.  Why the rest of the world hasn't caught on to Daylight Savings Time
mystifies me.  Johnny likely lives in or near Thunder Bay, making him
GMT-5/GMT-4.

Talk to you soon,

P.S.  Sorry about the flood earlier - I'm _really_ curious why %LOGIQX% only

Sorry guys but there is more installation to do. It appears that the CygWin
stuff doesn't function 100% if you don't install it the proper way (I tried
to cheat to make it easier for you all). I only discovered the problem when
getting Pi to run through Lesson 1 as a test.

I have quickly written a CygWin installation guide with lots of screen
shots:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/cygwin.html

Can you please follow the guide to get it installed correctly on your
machines. It downloads about 10MB of data and takes about 38MB of disk once
installed.

You're right. I think I know why. I have the bad habit to try two things at
the same time. My prob was fixed when I placed the variable LOGIQX in the
System group instead of in the Administrator group.

No the last semicolon is not critical but my paths always end with one, so
somehow I guessed it was that.

Anyway with "Lesson 0 Part 2: The Return" is here. I guess that will be
easier, tho the last time I tried to install cygwin it added some strange
things...

Btw Talking about Tim Robbins' movies, like Nightmare before Xmas, you can
see
that Datman Returns. There is an update at Logiqx.com. Even when the team
has
not been formally introduced, it's mentioned. Your efforts are appreciated,
and you will be dat gods! Or at least dat priests? :)

Hi people

Well I'm talking in the name of god (i.e. Mike asked me to tell
you sumping).

The "uploader" task is only for him, err I mean for Him and for
Hadbeen who will be the site maintainer and generally the man on
the top. This is because anyone who wants to upload even a single
little tiny dat, must have every XML and ZIP up to date on their
PC, or it will screw the site (literal words from above).

So basically, you all will have enough with creating dats, and
Hadbeen will have enough maintaining the site. However you all
will get explained how to do it, so you know the process and can
package the things nicely and correctly to ease Hadbeen's work.

So in the team page, everyone has a - in the uploader place,
except Logiqx and Hadbeen.

(Well in fact Mike's email was longer, but well... He wanted it
explained)

Also since the list seems to start having quite traffic, I've
decided to split the digests by weeks. Note that email addys go
in there, if anyone wants one removed or modified, tell me.

Friday the 13th... Is it a good day for MAME 0.62 "the freaky
release"? Booooh.

ok,
everything worked fine up to this:
"2. Set up your PATH

After installation, add 'c:\cygwin\bin' (or the drive you chose) to your

You mean I have to do this? :

- Double-click the 'System' icon

- Select the 'Advanced' sheet (on Windows 2000, called 'Environment' on NT)
- Click on 'Environment Variables...'

- Click on 'New...' (under the 'System variables' section)
- Specify a variable name of 'LOGIQX' and value of 'c:\Logiqx'

- Select 'Path' (under the 'System variables' section)
- Click 'Edit...'
- Add ';%LOGIQX%\bin;' at the end of the value line and press 'OK'

On NT/2000/XP there is no need for a reboot (if you followed my steps
above)."

Hi Phil,

Yes, use control panel. The only difference is one line:

  Add ';c:\cygwin\bin;' at the end of the value line and press 'OK'.

In other words, '%LOGIQX%\bin' AND 'c:\cygwin\bin' are in your path.

Lesson 1 - The Dat Environment (MAME and CPS-2 creation used as an example)
========

After completing lesson 0, you will have these things set up:

- CygWin, with the 'bin' directory in your path.
- A Logiqx directory, with 'bin' directory in your path.
- A %LOGIQX% variable that points to the Logiqx directory.

You also need a new tool that I wrote yesterday:

   http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/tools-fixdups.zip (3KB)

Just extract it into your Logiqx directory. Afterwards, your bin directory
should look like this:

  68022 May 20 20:26 datutil.exe
    455 Sep 12 13:41 fixdups.c
  10941 Sep 12 13:41 fixdups.exe
1249280 Jun 16  2000 iXSLT.exe
  25935 May 20 20:25 mamediff.exe

Okay, lets gone on with the lesson.

PART 1 - Download it!
======

1) Download this file:

   http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/lesson1.zip (3170KB)

2) Extract it into your Logiqx directory.

PART 2 - The directory structure
======

The directory structure contained in lesson 1 is not just for demonstration
purposes, it is a fully functioning Logiqx set up! It is just a little
smaller
than mine since it only contains the stuff needed for MAME and CPS-2 though.

%LOGIQX%
   |
   +--Dats              ClrMamePro dats
   |  |
   |  +--Recent            Recent dats
   |     |
   |     +--Multi             Multi emulators (MAME, Kawaks, etc)
   |     |  |
   |     |  +--MAME              Files needed to make the MAME dat
   |     |
   |     +--Systems           Systems (CPS-2, Neo-Geo, etc)
   |        |
   |        +--CPS-2             Files needed to make the CPS-2 dat
   |
   +--Dats_RC           RomCenter dats
      |
      +--Recent            Recent dats
         |
         +--Multi             Multi emulators (MAME, Kawaks, etc)
         |  |
         |  +--MAME              All files needed to make the MAME dat
         |
         +--Systems           Systems (CPS-2, Neo-Geo, etc)
            |
            +--CPS-2             All files needed to make the CPS-2 dat

It is important to explain that no matter what the dat is, I always create
it
in CMPro format first and convert to RomCenter format using DatUtil. I never
do
it the other way around since dats are easier to edit in CMPro format and it
it is also much simpler to do everything the same way.

PART 3 - Automation whenever possible!
======

If something can be automated then that is what I do! It is faster, less
boring
and less prone to error. The reason that I am using MAME and CPS-2 to get
you
familiar with my environment is because they are generated 100%
automatically!

You don't need to understand anything about writing dats at this point.

PART 4 - The use of 'makefiles'
======

I achieve automation through the use of makefiles. I won't describe them in
too
much detail (since entire books are written on the subject) but I will
briefly
explain what makefiles are and how they work.

A makefile is typically used by people like C programmers but in essence it
lets you specify the way that a file is generated. If a file is generated
using another one as input, then the makefile defines a 'dependency' and
also
how to generate the one file from the other.

For example, I mentioned that my RomCenter dats are just generated by
converting the CMPro one (using DatUtil). A simple makefile rule for such an
action might look like this:

   Dats_RC/Recent/Multi/MAME.dat: Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME.dat
           datutil -o Dats_RC/Recent/Multi/MAME.dat
Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME.dat

What this rule says is that the RomCenter file is dependant on the CMPro
one.
If the CMPro file has a newer file date than the RomCenter one (or if the
RomCenter one does not exist), then the datutil command is run by make.

I use the same principal for any 'supplement' dat files that are produced.
For
example, the 'supplementary' dats that I make for Kawaks are dependant on
the
MAME dat and the Kawaks dat. If either dat has changed, then MAMEDiff should
be
used to generate the 'supplement dat'. This may be shown as:

   Supplement.dat: MAME.dat Kawaks.dat
           mamediff -S -T -o MAME.dat Kawaks.dat

Makefiles can be incredibly complex but mine are probably of medium
complexity.
The real techies amongst you may like to look at how they work and exactly
what
they do but the rest of you should just regard them as a 'black box' (i.e.
it
just does a job). You don't need to know how it does it's job, just that it
does do it!  At this moment I don't really want to explain them any further!

PART 5 - Generating a MAME dat
======

Inside the directory 'Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME' you will see several files but
the only two that get updated for a MAME release are:

- mamepp.exe           The current MAME executable
- MAME.vers.mak        The current version number of MAME

If you ever want to create your own MAME dat, then just replace mamepp.exe
and
update MAME.vers.mak accordingly.

Note: If you don't have a PPro then you need to copy your 'mame.exe' into
this
      directory and give it the name 'mamepp.exe'.

Inside the directory 'Dats/Recent/Multi' you will see a batch script called
'rebuild_all.bat'. This script just runs the 'make' command to rebuild all
multi emu dats that actually need a rebuild (currently you only have one
multi
emu though... MAME).

Double click 'rebuild_all.bat' and you will see all of the MAME dats get
built!

The makefile is just building them using DatUtil and MAMEDiff. Look at the
file 'MAME.rules.mak' to see exactly what is being done (if you are already
familiar with DatUtil and MAMEDiff).

PART 6 - Generating a CPS-2 dat
======

The CPS-2 dat is also generated 100% automatically, just like the MAME dat.

However, instead of using an executable (like mamepp.exe), I get given a
file
from Raz called 'cps2.dat'. This simply gets put into the 'CPS-2' folder and
'rebuild_all.bat' is run (after updating 'CPS-2.vers.mak' of course).

PART 7 - RomCenter conversion
======

The directories under 'Dats_RC' correspond exactly to the ones under the
'Dats'
directory. Each directory has a 'rebuild_all.bat' script and running them
will
generate RomCenter dats directly from your CMPro ones.

PART 8 - Try to understand the scripts/makefiles?
======

I know that some of you will look at them and understand most of what they
are
doing straight away. Others of you will be completely confused by them!
Just try to get an idea of how they hang together rather than worrying about
every single line of code. ;)

The main objective of this lesson is to ensure you have a working dat
environment and are beginning to understand that many things are
automatically
generated. You should even be able to create MAME and CPS-2 dats for
yourselves
too, assuming that you get a new mamepp.exe or cps2.dat!

As time goes by and different lessons cover different subjects, everything
should seem far simpler. I know that there will still be many questions left
to answer but this is just the first few steps of a long journey!

i think i can invent some scripts.

Has anyone tried Lesson1 yet, other than Pi?

Explanation to Pi: fixdups.exe removes duplicate ROMs (occurs in MAME
listinfo). I am bored of doing it by hand every time I do a MAME dat so it
was easiest to write a simple program (fixdups.exe) rather than incorporate
a new feature in DatUtil.

No problem sir !

All system go :-)

P.S. One question: In "rebuild_all.mak" you include "standard_header.mak"
and "mame_ver.mak", but about the last one, why you include it here, when it
is already include in "standard_header.mak " ?, maybe cos in
"standard_header.mak" it have a general value, instead in "rebuild_all.mak",
have a value like each other "multi-emulator" ;-)

Simple:

SET LOGIQX=D:\Logiqx
PATH=%LOGIQX%\bin;

It didn't work but

SET LOGIQX=D:\Logiqx
PATH=%LOGIQX%\bin;

works, why?

Because when you copy whole two lines to the autoexec.bat
then the first line is:
SET LOGIQX=D:\Logiqx"space character"

so %LOGIQX%\bin; is actually ;d\logiqx \bin;
which is wrong (you got an error: to many parameters!)

Hope it helps.

Mike but i want to get through all automation.
Step by step to understand how and why it has been done.

I was always using C++ for such a automation (which was a bit pain
since i have to work on the lists - open bats getting output ... and
so) - I always wanted to switch to scripts - since it is easier and
faster.

Hi Mike!

everything fine here, however I have some other dev tools
from Borland, MS in my path, those will fail w/ the dat
creation (and I DO NOT want to change the order of my path).

As a workaround I created a batch file with the line

 @path=%LOGIQX%\bin;x:\cygwin\bin

This will temporarily change the path, for Win9x this is not
recommended (reboot anybody?)...

Never fear. I will explain all those things in detail from lesson 3 or 4
onwards.

Firstly I'm just giving an overview of all aspects relevant to the team
(breadth first, then depth). I just want to explain things in bite sized
junks otherwise I'll probably overload some people and it would take too
long to write all at once anyway. ;)

Patience.  Take it 1 step at a time.  To quote Mike:

"Makefiles can be incredibly complex but mine are probably of medium
complexity.
The real techies amongst you may like to look at how they work and exactly
what
they do but the rest of you should just regard them as a 'black box' (i.e.
it
just does a job). You don't need to know how it does it's job, just that it
does do it!  At this moment I don't really want to explain them any

Besides, you're a lot more advanced than I was at 17. :)

I am the "maintainer" of that part... I have a local copy which I modify and
then I upload everything.
Sadly enough, at 29 years old I seem to suffer alzheimer or something, cause

Hi everyone,

I will be distributing lesson 2 later today. The ZIPs are now ready but I
have to write the text still (either during my lunch time or when I get home
tonight). I'm sure that you will enjoy it more than the first one! After
this we will have all aspects of a common environment; covering everything
from dat creation to packaging and uploading.

For lesson 1 I re-wrote the makefiles of dat creation to use seperate
directories. This made them all look simpler and also makes team work more
viable too. For lesson 2, I have done the same to the web side of things
(XML etc). This definitely makes it look simpler to understand and makes the
submission of updates much, much easier. You will see why when I explain it
later.

After lesson 2, I'll prepare some stuff so that some of the simpler tasks
can be started (these will still be in the form of lessons).

Better mention this too: I go away on Friday, returning on the Sunday about
a week later. I'm off to western Ireland for some decent wavesailing. :) I'm
going to Brandon Bay near Dingle, which is the location that all the pro
wnidsurfers are going to for their next competition (a week after I am
there).

Responder a: teamlogiqx@emuverse.com

End of my working day, so here is today's lesson for you all.

Lesson 2 - Packaging dats and updating the web site
========

In addition to everything installed in lessons 0 and 1 (Cygwin, etc), you
need another tool:

   http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/tools-filechk.zip (39KB)

Just extract it into your Logiqx directory.

Also check that you have iXSLT.exe in 'bin' (it was part of lesson 0).
iXSLT wasn't used in any scripts for lesson 1 but it is needed for lesson 2.

PART 1 - Download the lesson!
======

1) Download this file:

   http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/lesson2.zip (3830KB)

2) Extract it into your Logiqx directory.

This replaces the 24MB file that you downloaded a while ago
(logiqx_www.zip).

PART 2 - The directory structure
======

The directory structure contained in lesson 2 is not just for demonstration
purposes, it is a fully functioning Logiqx.com mirror. It is just a little
smaller than mine though, since it only contains the stuff needed for dats.

%LOGIQX%
   |

PART 3 - Use of archive bits!
======

In order to cut down the size of uploads (i.e. only upload new/changed
files),
I make extensive use of the 'archive' bit. All files have an 'archive' bit
which gets 'set' every time a file is changed (or created).

When you extract the files from lesson1.zip, the archive bit will be set for
every file. This is not particularly desirable so I have provided a script
to
reset them. To 'clear' the archive bits, run 'WWW/archive_bit_clear.bat'
(just
double click on it).

PART 4 - Packaging ZIPs
======

Lesson 1 gave you a rough idea about what the 'Dats' and 'Dats_RC'
directories
are. Once dats have been created in those areas (and all testing has been
done), simply ZIP them up and copy the ZIPs into the appropriate directory
under 'WWW/Dats'.

PART 5 - Editing the XML (contents of the web pages)
======

The dat related web pages are all generated using XML. This means that all
of
the information for an emulator dat is located in one location (the XML) and
shared by all of the web pages in which it appears (contents pages, emulator
pages, etc). This ensures consistency throughout the site and reduces the
amount of work involved when making updates.

To update the details for an individual dat, edit the appropriate '.ent.xml'
file within the 'WWW/Dats' directory (e.g. 'Dats/MAME/MAME.ent.xml').

The details that generallt need updating are:

   Version                The version of the emulator/data file (e.g. v1.07)

   Suitability            Only used if different to 'Version' (e.g. v1.08
would
                          indicate that the dat can be used with v1.08 of
the
                          emulator, even thuogh the dat is for v1.07.

   Status (New/Updated)   Either 'New', 'Updated' or blank. It is this field
                          that results in the GIFs 'New.gif' or
'Updated.gif'
                          being used on the contents page.

   Date (DD/MM/YYYY)      The date that the page was updated.

   Games                  The number of games in the data file.

   Filenames and sizes    The file names and sizes of the ZIP files.

   Revisions              The revision history (details about changes made).

PART 6 - Rebuilding the HTML
======

To re-generate the HTML for emulator dats that have had their the XML
changed,
run the script 'rebuild_all.bat'. Those of you who completed lesson 1 will
have
guessed that this script runs... make!

The makefile will:

   - Rebuild individual emulator pages
   - Rebuild the Logiqx.com index page
   - Rebuild the RomCenter.com index page
   - Rebuild the details for the RomCenter web update facility
   - Validate all ZIP files details (check that they exist and check the
size).

Note: The ZIP validation (filechk.exe) is not case sensitive. I only wrote
it
      quickly and never went as far as doing that. If anyone feels like
making
      it better, they are more than welcome!

Also, an important point about the XML to HTML conversion is that I use a
piece
of software (iXSLT) that expires after 90 days. To avoid this problem, it is
as
simple as deleting a fake DLL that it creates in your windows directory (Pi
worked this out for me ages ago). The makefile does this automatically
though
so there is no need to worry about it!

PART 7 - Submitting work to the whole team (not just to the site maintainer)
======

Sharing your work with the rest of the team is easy.

- To share dat work with the team, just ZIP up the contents of:

     Dats/<old or recent>/<single or multi etc>/<emu dir>

- To submit web updates to the team, just ZIP up the contents of:

     WWW/Dats/<emu dir>    (i.e. an '.ent.xml' file and ZIPs).

Both ZIPs should be posted to the list but in the case of large files, we
will
have to set up a group FTP. Leslaw? ;) I would suggest that anything bigger
than 30KB be considered large and not sent via e-mail (bearing in mind that
some people only have 56K connections).

The site maintanier must extract the web updates into his own 'WWW'
directory
and run 'rebuild_all.bat' (to update the web pages). He is the only person
that
must keep up to date with every submission and will therefore the only
person
who can generate accurate index pages.

PART 8 - Updating the front page news (site maintainer; Robin)
======

Updating the front page is simply a matter of editing 'WWW/News/News.shtml'
(using your favorite HTML editor).

Every 3 months (Jan->Mar, Apr->Jun, Jul->Sep, Oct->Dec), I rename News.shtml
to NewsXX.shtml and start a fresh News.shtml.

PART 9 - Preparing the upload (site maintainer; Robin)
======

As already mentioned, the upload procedure utilises the archive flag of
files.
To 'tar' everything up ready for upload (think of 'tar' as the Unix
equivalent
for ZIP), just double-click 'WWW/make_gz.zip'.

What this does is:

- Copy all files that have their archive bit set (i.e. they have been
created
  or changed since the last run) to a directory called 'WWW_Update'. After
the
  copy, all archive bits are 'cleared'.

- TARs up and compresses the contents of the 'WWW_Update' directory into a
file
  called 'Upload/all.tar.gz'.

It is the file all.tar.gz that gets uploaded to Logiqx.com (via FTP) and
then
extracted using a CGI script (i.e. a simple URL).

Note: The 'WWW_Update' directory is not purged automatically. After
all.tar.gz
      has been uploaded and extracted, you should empty out 'WWW_Update' (or
      delete it completely).

Damn, that's the same error as Pi and you're both on XP. I've been using
this XML for two years on 95, 98, NT and 2000 so it's rather annoying to
discover it doesn't work under XP! The Infoteria web site (makers of iXSLT)
is down so I can't get hold of a newer version for you to try either.

When I get a chance I will ditch iXSLT and switch over to the XML tool I use
for CAESAR (Sablotron). However, that is going to be several hours of work
and I have to go out now. I am out tomorrow too so it is quite possible I
won't have a chance to try until Wednesday.

I am 99% sure it will work on all non XP machines!

Changed my mind and had a fiddle with Sablotron!

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/lesson2-xpfix.zip (47KB)

Includes a new XSLT engine (Sablotron) and new XML. Sablotron is actually
faster than iXSLT but it does not validate the XML as thoroughly as iXSLT
does (i.e. it just converts it as fast as possible).

Let me know if this works please! I really am going out now.

works perfect!

however, there were 3 issues i had to fix:
1) mame 61.zip won't extract from lesson2.zip (crc error)
2) sablotron needs "sablot.dll"
(http://download-2.gingerall.cz/download/sablot/Sablot-Win-0.96.zip)
3) ..and "extpat.dll"
(http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat_win32bin_1_95_5.exe)

i've got a similar error here but it seems to occur only if run
filechk.exe via the makefile. the command by itself
(filechk.exe [file.lst]) doesn't produce this error.

It looks like filechk.exe was compiled with DJGPP a long time ago (i.e. it
is a DOS program).

I have just recompiled it using MinGW and will re-upload shortly.

I have just tidied up the ZIPs needed by the team:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/

If you are missing anything, you can find it in one of the new ZIPs.

Regarding Lesson 2:

- Anyone who installed the 'XP fix' needs to update their WWW/Dats makefile
(attached).
- Anyone who didn't install the fix should delete the WWW directory and
redownload lesson 2 (it is now correct).

Hopefully after this we'll all be using the same stuff!

Hi all,

As many of you have managed the last lesson successfully (just needing the
latest filechk.exe), we can try doing one of the immediate tasks as a
practise exercise!

I have uploaded a ZIP to the download area and it contains makefiles for all
of the resources that have been updated. In most cases the makefiles just
copy the dats to a nicer name but the file size, CRC and datestamp are
preserved (so that it is obvious that the file is unchanged).

Anyhow, the task/exercise is (for a couple of dats of your choice):

1) To package the dats into their appropriate ZIPs. Naming standard as
follows:

- MAME Artwork 20020916 (cm).zip           CMPro
- MAME Artwork 20020916 (rc).zip           RomCenter

2) To update the web page XML. Obviously, you can test your work with the
lesson 2 environment. :)
   You may need the latest filechk.exe to ensure that the filename
validation is effective.

3) To ZIP up the WWW/Dats/xxx directories and put them on the FTP.

I'll let people pick the dats that they want to package because duplication
isn't too important right now. I think this exercise will be of benefit to
all dat creators and packagers. ;)

You could always run it through DatUtil and see how many ROMs it reports.

> or the like) or what to write in the "comment" element of the revisions

Maybe just:

'Uploaded the latest release by Eldio. Now matches MAME v0.61.'

..or something like that. The home pages of the other resources will
probably say what their last update was for too (mostly for MAME v0.61).

> could you check that if i did anything wrong?

Looks good to me. I like XMLSpy too. :)

Two minor things:

- I use the 'date' field in the XML for the upload date (so it is clear when
it became available on the site).
- What are those popups in WinZip? They're a little annoying. ;)

> i'll do the other ressources later...

Much appreciated. Leave a few for the others though. :)

Hey all,

Here's MAME Artwork 20020917 for you all.  I can't seem to get anywhere with
the FTP - I can log on, but the 'LIST' command seems to time out.

Actually filechk.exe (the new one) flashed something about 'Error

Zipped and attached.

Maybe to do with passive mode or something?

Do you have the latest makefile (posted to the list yesterday)? The old one
had the 'pause' command at the bottom commented out, amongst other things.

Ah, seeing as you actually updated your dat you also need to provide the
contents of 'Dats/Recent/Resources/MAME Artwork' to the rest of the team. :)

I compared it to Roman's dat (the one already in exercise1.zip) and apart
from the fact that his lacks leading 0s on CRCs (I have just mailed him
about this), yours has some uppercase filenames which should be made
lowercase (the source ZIPs should not used mixed case filenames). Datutil
'-l' can be used to fix it before release.

In the XML, don't forget to change the status to 'Updated' and update the
dates/versions. You should be able to spot them if you open
'WWW/index.shtml'. ;)

Yup.

None of the files in that folder changed.  Did I err?

I was debating going to all lower case, but (fool that I am) I wasn't aware
of -l.

You should really edit the dat in that folder and the one in the folder
above (Dats/Recent/Resources) is rebuilt automatically by the batch script.
The .ver.mak is used by the automatic RomCenter conversion too.

I have done MameIcons,
Everything went smooth. (Though i have to switch to sabcmd.exe,
iXSLT.exe doesn't work on my machine - same error - i am using Win98).
Take a look let me know if this is fine.

Anyway - there will be a tiny problem with: MAME Flyers, since the dat
includes md5 information and Datutil can't handle it.
But i can write a program which will remove md5 info (need to find my
old sources) - or you have already done it?

As to the ftp.
It is WarFtp (it's a bit shitty) - i will switch it to RaidenFtpd some
time. (It is running for a 2 years now and there was a couple of
problems with uploading).

Try to use Passive Mode - there will be no problem then.

Well done.

That's okay, everyone should be using sabcmd now. My emulator XML is not
compatible with both iXSLT and sabcmd (due to a bug in iXSLT) so from now on
we use sabcmd only.

>Take a look let me know if this is fine.

Looks okay to me. You are just missing '<status>Updated</status>' in the
entity.

>includes md5 information and Datutil can't handle it.

So far as I know, DatUtil just ignores it. The RomCenter conversion on my
machine looks okay (I haven't loaded it into RomCenter mind).

I think it would be a good idea if we try to make the FTP resemble the
structure of our work area.

I've created some directories that will do us to be getting on with and
moved current files to their appropriate locations. This should make it easy
for us in the future (e.g. when we want to find the latest 'xxx' source dat
or 'xxx' web update), without snooping in everyone's personal folder.

I've finally got around to looking at this emulator and updating the dat by
Roman. I have to type quick because my girlfriend will be here soon!

Okay, I can improve on the dat and here is what I have done:

1) Made it evident that there are six games by using clones (previous dat
showed four games).
2) Changed his 00000000 CRCs in Ridge Racer to complimented CRCs. The Dumps
may be bad but they are the best available!
3) Added year information (use www.system16.com and www.klov.com to find
years if needed).
4) Swapped the size and crc bits around (I prefer CRC last!). Just use
DatUtil to re-save in my prefered format. ;)

To tell if a dump is bad, use ROMCMP.EXE (comes with MAME):

E:\ROMs\Complete\Recent\Multi\Viva Nonno>romcmp rr1.zip
21 files
rr1ccrh.bin                                     FIRST AND SECOND HALF
IDENTICAL
rr1ccrl.bin                                     FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xx11xxxxxx)
rr1cg0.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1cg1.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1cg2.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1cg3.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1data.bin                                          11xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1pot-l1.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1pot-m1.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1pot-u1.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1prg-ll.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1prg-lm.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1prg-um.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1prg-uu.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF

- It can be seen that rr1ccrh.bin has been overdumped (should be half the
size).
- It can be seen that the ccrl and cg ROMs are bad (they have stuck bits).

I did ROMCMP checks on all Viva ROMs and there was another game which needed
a CRC complimenting. RomCenter shows games that have complimented CRCs with
a little 'x' next to the game.

That's it. Need to get this all uploaded before Kay arrives. ;)

Hi people

I've been a bit away of myself lately, but I've just updated the
page with the latest lessons and things. I also need to check
again the outdated dats since some of you are doing real work,
congrats guys :)

The thing is that I also want to update the digest and I would
like opinions. By months will be killer, by weeks is not feasible
since one week is 35kb and other is 110 and who knows how much
will be the next ones. Any idea? Each 50 or 100 messages maybe?

Do you read CAESAR to be up to date with what's happening on the

Hmm, rr1cg0.bin - it is not filled in with any recurrence patterns?
How romcmp knows it's bad - or it checks even part of the file?
Anyway - need to remember this romcmp technique.

Remember that System16 only has Sega, Taito, Atari and Konami hardware. So
its
game list is somewhat limited (tho very representative specially in the more
recent years). KLOV is known to be very innacurate sometimes, there is a
famous
example with PaperBoy (http://www.klov.com/P/Paperboy.html) which apparently
has
a hard drive :-D And after all this time and all these laughs, it's still
not
fixed!

So, these are MY resources when trying to find info for games *not* in
CAESAR:
http://www.system16.com/ - System 16 - The Arcade Museum
http://unmamed.mame.net/ - Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games
http://emustatus.rainemu.com/ - Emulation Status

If the game is emulated, then it's in CAESAR, then you don't need to search
for
that info ;)

Will put these three resources in the team page, with KLOV, bleh.

It means that that bit 10 is 'stuck'. It's a classic ROM dumping issue (bad
connections in the rig). It is far more likely than not that it is a bad
dump (I don't think any genuine ROMs have ever seen this problem).

> How romcmp knows it's bad - or it checks even part of the file?

It checks the whole file (doesn't work off CRCs).

> Anyway - need to remember this romcmp technique.

It is my favorite tool. Comparing ROMs is even better! Use the -d option for
a detailed comparison of two ZIPs.

I like KLOV but I am aware of it's years sometimes being wrong. I always
look at two independant sources and if the year doesn't match look at more

Hi all,

This exercise requires a little more thinking to improve your familiarity
with the makefile stuff.

Attached are 3 ZIPs to extract into:

Dats/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats).zip
Dats_RC/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats_RC).zip
WWW/Dats - VivaNonno-Logiqx.zip

Extract them all and see if you can add Viva Nonno to the rebuild_all.mak
files! Use existing MAME entries as a guide.

Tip: In makefiles, where a filename contains spaces you need to use a '?'
instead.

Just so as you can see it visually, the <status> element of the XML has an
effect on the dat index page (see attachment).

- If a value is specified then the entry is made bold.
- If the value is 'Updated' then you get an 'Updated' GIF.
- If the value is 'New' then you get an 'New' GIF.

Be sure not to just type 'Update' you don't get the GIF (as seen in the
snapshot).

Whenever changing the XML, always check the emulator page and the index
page. I'm always making small mistakes but I ususally spot them by checking
how the pages actually look. ;)

For the more advanced of you, who have already:

- Set up a working Logiqx environment
- Completed lessons 0 and 1
- Completed exercise 2

Please download these!

/WinKawaks.zip

ftp://leslaw:leslaw@149.156.75.202:2121/leslaw/LOGIQX_TEAM/Dats/Recent/Multi
/WinKawaks%20(RC).zip

After doing exercise 2 you should be able to install them easily.

-------------------------------------
e.g.
-------------------------------------

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/standard_header.mak

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME/MAME.vers.mak
include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/WinKawaks.vers.mak

recent_multi: \
        mame \
        winkawaks \
        cleanup

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME/MAME.rules.mak
include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/WinKawaks.rules.mak

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/standard_footer.mak

--------------------------------------

Inside Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/v1.45 I have left notes and logs from all
of my workings during the dat update. Sorry it's not a little more
descriptive but I am at work and want to get this out to you before I go on
holiday tomorrow morning! However, anyone familiar with DatUtil and MAMEDiff
should be able to understand it given a little time.

I added or fixed about 156 games in roughly 20 to 30 minutes. Should be 100%
accurate too. :)

Read 'v1.45 instructions.txt' to find out how I did it.

L> Dats/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats).zip
L> Dats_RC/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats_RC).zip
L> WWW/Dats - VivaNonno-Logiqx.zip

Done, see zip attached, I have also done www rebuild_all.make
and i prefer putting Viva Nonno dats in
Dats/Recent/Viva Nonno/ directory.
(which was resulting in a bit confusion with
CMP_DIR= $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Viva?Nonno (doesn't work)
solved by CMP_DIR= $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/VivaNo~1 )

Tell me what you think.
(I have checked them - all work, even www generation!).

I think having different directory trees is a bad idea though. It means that
we have incompatible makefiles with each other and sharing work will cause
more work and confusion. The idea of the multi directory is simply so that
we have one makefile to update everything, not one makefile for each
emulator. The extra layer (single/multi/system/sound) is to seperate out
seperate types of dat and keep directory sizes down a little.

We want to have self contained archives that work for everyone without
modification. ;)

that's fine. But you know why i choose a directory different from
/Multi ? That's because in this directory there is already
rebuild_all.mak i bat (those from Mame), so i have to delete them or
rename them. and also all dats will be made in the /Multi directory -
bit if that's fine that's ok for me.
i have already changed this to what you suggest though renaming
rebuild_all_mame.bat i mak and
rebuild_all_viva.bat i mak.
is that fine?
Or we should put everything in a one rebuild.all.bat and dat?

You just need one rebuild_all.mak.

Example from lesson 4:

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/standard_header.mak

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME/MAME.vers.mak
include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/WinKawaks.vers.mak

recent_multi: \
        mame \
        winkawaks \
        cleanup

I am running late now so this will have to be very brief!

I have upload my Nebula work to the FTP (under
Leslaw/LOGIQX_TEAM/Dats/Recent/Multi).

If you extract these you will see that there are two batch scripts:

- One to validate the auto-generated dat
- One to validate mine

Reading the logs is a little confusing but they are an unbelievably useful
for identifying which games need looking at. As you can see, the inbuilt one
has loads of errors but mine has none. ;)

The games listed in the log for my dat are CPS-2 clones (listed because
drivers don't specify all parent ROMs) and PGM/Konami games (since they do
not have drivers).

Obviously, the proof of the pudding is to validate within Nebula itself (I
check a full set of ROMs using the full dat and MAME+supplement ROMs to
check the supplement dat). Everything is green for me.

There were a few driver errors causing name conflicts so I've fixed them and
sent them to ElSemi so he can use them next release.

I guys, after my relative long absence (for the amount of work make during

the first thing I need to do is "exercise 1".  After long reading, the flood
subsequential to that exercise I have discover (hope) that the only resurces
that need to be updated are "MAME Snaps", and "MAME Titles", both make by
John IV, so now I start doing my homework with this one, hope relase this

Hi Mike,

1) Maybe I just don't understand that right, but why is VivaNonno
in the Multi dir?
I thought the multi stands for multi-systems, like MAME or
Nebula, but VivaNonno emulates just one system, shouldn't it
be in the "Single" or "Systems" folder ?

2) I noticed some spelling differences, e.g. in the rebuild_all.mak
first it is "Viva Nonno" (= "Viva?Nonno"), then in line #8 it is
spelled "viva_nonno"; in the WWW folder it's spelled "VivaNonno"
and inside the dat files again "Viva Nonno xxxxx".
Wouldn't it be much easier if every system has a unique name or id?

3) what's w/ those "rv1b" roms? I've never seen them anywhere before,
nor heard of them (even emuchina doesn't have), so how is the
team supposed to know about them make good dats and validate them?
Do we have to wait for the emu authors/the guru to get us the info
or do we have to "edit" the emus and extract the name/crc from them
or is there a "secret place" in the www where those roms are stored?

(Note: this is NOT a rom request in any form! it's a delicate subject,
especially for those "new" 3D hardware games. since the whole thing
is somehow not legal, I'm almost sure that nobody from us has all those
arcade PCBs at home, I wish I had some though...
I think in some ways the team does have the rights to keep the roms
for some time because we are helping those actual owners of the arcade
hardware to validate their backups!)

ciao.stefan
