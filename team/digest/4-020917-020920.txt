id 416, Win32 error 6
All files in file.lst are okay.

Press any key to continue . . .

I'm using sabcmd.exe (with sablot.dll and expat.dll renamed to
libexpat.dll).

It looks like filechk.exe was compiled with DJGPP a long time ago (i.e. it
is a DOS program).

I have just recompiled it using MinGW and will re-upload shortly.

I have just tidied up the ZIPs needed by the team:

http://www.logiqx.com/team/download/

If you are missing anything, you can find it in one of the new ZIPs.

Regarding Lesson 2:

- Anyone who installed the 'XP fix' needs to update their WWW/Dats makefile
(attached).
- Anyone who didn't install the fix should delete the WWW directory and
redownload lesson 2 (it is now correct).

Hopefully after this we'll all be using the same stuff!

Hi all,

As many of you have managed the last lesson successfully (just needing the
latest filechk.exe), we can try doing one of the immediate tasks as a
practise exercise!

I have uploaded a ZIP to the download area and it contains makefiles for all
of the resources that have been updated. In most cases the makefiles just
copy the dats to a nicer name but the file size, CRC and datestamp are
preserved (so that it is obvious that the file is unchanged).

Anyhow, the task/exercise is (for a couple of dats of your choice):

1) To package the dats into their appropriate ZIPs. Naming standard as
follows:

- MAME Artwork 20020916 (cm).zip           CMPro
- MAME Artwork 20020916 (rc).zip           RomCenter

2) To update the web page XML. Obviously, you can test your work with the
lesson 2 environment. :)
   You may need the latest filechk.exe to ensure that the filename
validation is effective.

3) To ZIP up the WWW/Dats/xxx directories and put them on the FTP.

I'll let people pick the dats that they want to package because duplication
isn't too important right now. I think this exercise will be of benefit to
all dat creators and packagers. ;)

You could always run it through DatUtil and see how many ROMs it reports.

Maybe just:

'Uploaded the latest release by Eldio. Now matches MAME v0.61.'

..or something like that. The home pages of the other resources will
probably say what their last update was for too (mostly for MAME v0.61).

> could you check that if i did anything wrong?

Looks good to me. I like XMLSpy too. :)

Two minor things:

- I use the 'date' field in the XML for the upload date (so it is clear when
it became available on the site).
- What are those popups in WinZip? They're a little annoying. ;)

> i'll do the other ressources later...

Much appreciated. Leave a few for the others though. :)

Do you have the latest makefile (posted to the list yesterday)? The old one
had the 'pause' command at the bottom commented out, amongst other things.

Ah, seeing as you actually updated your dat you also need to provide the
contents of 'Dats/Recent/Resources/MAME Artwork' to the rest of the team. :)

I compared it to Roman's dat (the one already in exercise1.zip) and apart
from the fact that his lacks leading 0s on CRCs (I have just mailed him
about this), yours has some uppercase filenames which should be made

You should really edit the dat in that folder and the one in the folder
above (Dats/Recent/Resources) is rebuilt automatically by the batch script.
The .ver.mak is used by the automatic RomCenter conversion too.

I have done MameIcons,
Everything went smooth. (Though i have to switch to sabcmd.exe,
iXSLT.exe doesn't work on my machine - same error - i am using Win98).
Take a look let me know if this is fine.

Anyway - there will be a tiny problem with: MAME Flyers, since the dat
includes md5 information and Datutil can't handle it.
But i can write a program which will remove md5 info (need to find my
old sources) - or you have already done it?

It is WarFtp (it's a bit shitty) - i will switch it to RaidenFtpd some

Try to use Passive Mode - there will be no problem then.

That's okay, everyone should be using sabcmd now. My emulator XML is not
compatible with both iXSLT and sabcmd (due to a bug in iXSLT) so from now on
we use sabcmd only.

Looks okay to me. You are just missing '<status>Updated</status>' in the
entity.

So far as I know, DatUtil just ignores it. The RomCenter conversion on my
machine looks okay (I haven't loaded it into RomCenter mind).

I think it would be a good idea if we try to make the FTP resemble the
structure of our work area.

I've created some directories that will do us to be getting on with and
moved current files to their appropriate locations. This should make it easy
for us in the future (e.g. when we want to find the latest 'xxx' source dat
or 'xxx' web update), without snooping in everyone's personal folder.

I've finally got around to looking at this emulator and updating the dat by
Roman. I have to type quick because my girlfriend will be here soon!

Okay, I can improve on the dat and here is what I have done:

1) Made it evident that there are six games by using clones (previous dat
showed four games).
2) Changed his 00000000 CRCs in Ridge Racer to complimented CRCs. The Dumps
may be bad but they are the best available!
3) Added year information (use www.system16.com and www.klov.com to find
years if needed).
4) Swapped the size and crc bits around (I prefer CRC last!). Just use
DatUtil to re-save in my prefered format. ;)

To tell if a dump is bad, use ROMCMP.EXE (comes with MAME):

E:\ROMs\Complete\Recent\Multi\Viva Nonno>romcmp rr1.zip
21 files
rr1ccrh.bin                                     FIRST AND SECOND HALF
IDENTICAL
rr1ccrl.bin                                     FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xx11xxxxxx)
rr1cg0.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1cg1.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1cg2.bin                                      FIXED BITS

rr1cg3.bin                                      FIXED BITS
(xxxxx0xxxxxxxxxx)
rr1data.bin                                          11xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1pot-l1.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1pot-m1.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1pot-u1.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1prg-ll.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =

rr1prg-lm.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =

rr1prg-um.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF
rr1prg-uu.bin                                        1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx =
0xFF

- It can be seen that rr1ccrh.bin has been overdumped (should be half the
size).
- It can be seen that the ccrl and cg ROMs are bad (they have stuck bits).

I did ROMCMP checks on all Viva ROMs and there was another game which needed
a CRC complimenting. RomCenter shows games that have complimented CRCs with
a little 'x' next to the game.

That's it. Need to get this all uploaded before Kay arrives. ;)

Hmm, rr1cg0.bin - it is not filled in with any recurrence patterns?
How romcmp knows it's bad - or it checks even part of the file?
Anyway - need to remember this romcmp technique.

Remember that System16 only has Sega, Taito, Atari and Konami hardware. So
its
game list is somewhat limited (tho very representative specially in the more
recent years). KLOV is known to be very innacurate sometimes, there is a
famous
example with PaperBoy (http://www.klov.com/P/Paperboy.html) which apparently
has
a hard drive :-D And after all this time and all these laughs, it's still
not
fixed!

So, these are MY resources when trying to find info for games *not* in
CAESAR:
http://www.system16.com/ - System 16 - The Arcade Museum
http://unmamed.mame.net/ - Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games
http://emustatus.rainemu.com/ - Emulation Status

If the game is emulated, then it's in CAESAR, then you don't need to search
for
that info ;)

Will put these three resources in the team page, with KLOV, bleh.

It means that that bit 10 is 'stuck'. It's a classic ROM dumping issue (bad
connections in the rig). It is far more likely than not that it is a bad
dump (I don't think any genuine ROMs have ever seen this problem).

> How romcmp knows it's bad - or it checks even part of the file?

It checks the whole file (doesn't work off CRCs).

> Anyway - need to remember this romcmp technique.

It is my favorite tool. Comparing ROMs is even better! Use the -d option for
a detailed comparison of two ZIPs.

I like KLOV but I am aware of it's years sometimes being wrong. I always
look at two independant sources and if the year doesn't match look at more

Hi all,

This exercise requires a little more thinking to improve your familiarity
with the makefile stuff.

Attached are 3 ZIPs to extract into:

Dats/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats).zip
Dats_RC/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats_RC).zip
WWW/Dats - VivaNonno-Logiqx.zip

Extract them all and see if you can add Viva Nonno to the rebuild_all.mak
files! Use existing MAME entries as a guide.

Tip: In makefiles, where a filename contains spaces you need to use a '?'
instead.

Just so as you can see it visually, the <status> element of the XML has an
effect on the dat index page (see attachment).

- If a value is specified then the entry is made bold.
- If the value is 'Updated' then you get an 'Updated' GIF.
- If the value is 'New' then you get an 'New' GIF.

Be sure not to just type 'Update' you don't get the GIF (as seen in the
snapshot).

Whenever changing the XML, always check the emulator page and the index
page. I'm always making small mistakes but I ususally spot them by checking
how the pages actually look. ;)

Inside Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/v1.45 I have left notes and logs from all
of my workings during the dat update. Sorry it's not a little more
descriptive but I am at work and want to get this out to you before I go on
holiday tomorrow morning! However, anyone familiar with DatUtil and MAMEDiff
should be able to understand it given a little time.

I added or fixed about 156 games in roughly 20 to 30 minutes. Should be 100%
accurate too. :)

Read 'v1.45 instructions.txt' to find out how I did it.

L> This exercise requires a little more thinking to improve your familiarity

L> Attached are 3 ZIPs to extract into:

L> Dats/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats).zip
L> Dats_RC/Recent/Multi - Viva Nonno (Dats_RC).zip
L> WWW/Dats - VivaNonno-Logiqx.zip

Done, see zip attached, I have also done www rebuild_all.make
and i prefer putting Viva Nonno dats in
Dats/Recent/Viva Nonno/ directory.
(which was resulting in a bit confusion with
CMP_DIR= $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Viva?Nonno (doesn't work)
solved by CMP_DIR= $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/VivaNo~1 )

Tell me what you think.
(I have checked them - all work, even www generation!).

Well done.

I think having different directory trees is a bad idea though. It means that
we have incompatible makefiles with each other and sharing work will cause
more work and confusion. The idea of the multi directory is simply so that
we have one makefile to update everything, not one makefile for each
emulator. The extra layer (single/multi/system/sound) is to seperate out
seperate types of dat and keep directory sizes down a little.

We want to have self contained archives that work for everyone without
modification. ;)

that's fine. But you know why i choose a directory different from
/Multi ? That's because in this directory there is already
rebuild_all.mak i bat (those from Mame), so i have to delete them or
rename them. and also all dats will be made in the /Multi directory -
bit if that's fine that's ok for me.
i have already changed this to what you suggest though renaming
rebuild_all_mame.bat i mak and
rebuild_all_viva.bat i mak.
is that fine?
Or we should put everything in a one rebuild.all.bat and dat?

You just need one rebuild_all.mak.

Example from lesson 4:

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/standard_header.mak

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME/MAME.vers.mak
include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/WinKawaks.vers.mak

recent_multi: \
        mame \
        winkawaks \
        cleanup

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/MAME/MAME.rules.mak
include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/Recent/Multi/WinKawaks/WinKawaks.rules.mak

include $(LOGIQX)/Dats/standard_footer.mak

I am running late now so this will have to be very brief!

I have upload my Nebula work to the FTP (under
Leslaw/LOGIQX_TEAM/Dats/Recent/Multi).

If you extract these you will see that there are two batch scripts:

- One to validate the auto-generated dat
- One to validate mine

Reading the logs is a little confusing but they are an unbelievably useful
for identifying which games need looking at. As you can see, the inbuilt one
has loads of errors but mine has none. ;)

The games listed in the log for my dat are CPS-2 clones (listed because
drivers don't specify all parent ROMs) and PGM/Konami games (since they do
not have drivers).

Obviously, the proof of the pudding is to validate within Nebula itself (I
check a full set of ROMs using the full dat and MAME+supplement ROMs to
check the supplement dat). Everything is green for me.

There were a few driver errors causing name conflicts so I've fixed them and
sent them to ElSemi so he can use them next release.

I guys, after my relative long absence (for the amount of work make during
my absence it very long :-)), I'm back here, I have downloaded new mail, and
the first thing I need to do is "exercise 1".  After long reading, the flood
subsequential to that exercise I have discover (hope) that the only resurces
that need to be updated are "MAME Snaps", and "MAME Titles", both make by
John IV, so now I start doing my homework with this one, hope relase this
DATs later today.

Hi Mike,

1) Maybe I just don't understand that right, but why is VivaNonno
in the Multi dir?
I thought the multi stands for multi-systems, like MAME or
Nebula, but VivaNonno emulates just one system, shouldn't it
be in the "Single" or "Systems" folder ?

2) I noticed some spelling differences, e.g. in the rebuild_all.mak
first it is "Viva Nonno" (= "Viva?Nonno"), then in line #8 it is
spelled "viva_nonno"; in the WWW folder it's spelled "VivaNonno"
and inside the dat files again "Viva Nonno xxxxx".
Wouldn't it be much easier if every system has a unique name or id?

3) what's w/ those "rv1b" roms? I've never seen them anywhere before,
nor heard of them (even emuchina doesn't have), so how is the
team supposed to know about them make good dats and validate them?
Do we have to wait for the emu authors/the guru to get us the info
or do we have to "edit" the emus and extract the name/crc from them
or is there a "secret place" in the www where those roms are stored?

(Note: this is NOT a rom request in any form! it's a delicate subject,
especially for those "new" 3D hardware games. since the whole thing
is somehow not legal, I'm almost sure that nobody from us has all those
arcade PCBs at home, I wish I had some though...
I think in some ways the team does have the rights to keep the roms
for some time because we are helping those actual owners of the arcade
hardware to validate their backups!)

ciao.stefan
