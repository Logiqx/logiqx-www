<h1>Lesson 7: Not really a lesson but useful reading</h1>

<p><strong>(Posted on the list by Logiqx on Oct 3rd)</strong> </p>

<p>Hi everyone, a few things to mention today.</p>

<hr>

<p>1) As you may have noticed on the logiqx.com site, I've
updated a few more dats. </p>

<p>Most of these address problems that '_check_merging.bat'
reported (I have now checked every single dat for merge
problems).</p>

<p>ACE is the only genuine dat update (added sgemf). </p>

<hr>

<p>2) There is a new '_check_merging.sh' that shows CRC conflicts
too (needed for Calice).</p>

<p>You can get it by re-downloading <a
href="../download/tools-logiqx.zip">tools-logiqx.zip</a> (if you
have not done so recently).</p>

<hr>

<p>3) I have improved the dat makefiles after considering
Stefan's comments: </p>

<p>&gt;I noticed some spelling differences, e.g. in the
rebuild_all.mak <br>
&gt;first it is &quot;Viva Nonno&quot; (=
&quot;Viva?Nonno&quot;), then in line #8 it is <br>
&gt;spelled &quot;viva_nonno&quot;; in the WWW folder it's
spelled &quot;VivaNonno&quot; <br>
&gt;and inside the dat files again &quot;Viva Nonno xxxxx&quot;. </p>

<p>The lower-case reference (e.g. viva_nonno) is no longer used.
Instead, it uses a name that matches the rest of the makefile
rules (i.e. Viva?Nonno). </p>

<p>We are left with just 3 variants now but that is for good
reason: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Viva Nonno - The 'human' name for dat files, ZIPs etc</li>
    <li>Viva?Nonno - The question mark is required within
        makefile rules</li>
    <li>VivaNonno - The XML entity name (website directory
        corresponds for consistency). Reason, XML identifiers can
        not have space in them.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we are now as consistent as we can be considering we use 3
different technologies (regular files for humans, makefile rules,
XML entities). ;) </p>

<hr>

<p>4) I updated all makefiles that simply 'cp' (i.e. copy) dats
or txt files, now they all use the 'subst' trick.</p>

<p>This is much better than before, imho. </p>

<hr>

<p>5) U64Emu is now officially 'old', lol. </p>

<hr>

<p>6) For the latest 'Dats', 'Dats_RC' and 'WWW' directories, use
these links: </p>

<p><a href="../download/Dats.zip">Dats.zip</a>, <a
href="../download/Dats_RC.zip">Dats_RC.zip</a>, <a
href="../download/WWW.zip">WWW.zip</a> </p>

<p>After a while I am sure that these wholesale changes will
cease and we can start distributing individual directories for
each emulator. ;) </p>

<hr>

<p>7) I made a start (and almost finished) the Calice dat, just
mslug4/mslug4n/kof2001 to add (when we have figured out the
correct dump to use). </p>

<p>Calice is a manually-intensive dat!</p>

<p>You will see in the latest 'Dats' directory (download from URL
above) that there is a comparison script for Calice that can
compare the drivers in two Calice releases and the latest dat
against the latest driver. Using this I was able to see which
games were added (or changed) then look at the Calice drivers to
figure out which dump is really required (he doesn't always use
the right ZIP name). David has a habit of getting ZIP names and
ROM names incorrect so after copying a game from the CPS-2 dat I
checked every single ROM name and corrected it in my dat where
Calice uses the wrong name.</p>

<p>Incorrect ROM names cause many CRC conflicts (shown by
'_check_merging.bat/.sh') but these are unavoidable. Calice
doesn't load by CRC so it is better for us to have conflicts in
the dat and let the ROM managers sort out the mess. At least by
using the names he desires (albeit with conlicts), out comparison
scripts don't show any errors in our dat. ;)</p>

<hr>

<p>Tonight I don't plan on doing any computer-based work other
than:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Packaging the remaining resources and uploading to
        logiqx.com.</li>
    <li>Updating CAESAR for the emulators that we have recently
        released dats for.</li>
    <li>Updating my resource collections.</li>
    <li>Updating my Dad's website.</li>
</ul>
