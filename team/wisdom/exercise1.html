<h1>Exercise 1: <b>Packaging!</b></h1>

<p><strong>(Posted by Logiqx on the list on Sept 17th) </strong></p>

<p>As many of you have managed the last lesson successfully, we
can try doing one of the immediate tasks as a practise exercise! </p>

<p>I have uploaded <a href="zip/exercise1.zip">exercise1.zip</a>
to the download area that contains makefiles for all of the
resources that have recently been updated. In most cases the
makefiles just copy the dats to a nicer name but the file size,
CRC and datestamp are preserved (so that it is obvious that the
file is unchanged). </p>

<p>Anyhow, the task/exercise is (for a couple of dats of your
choice): </p>

<p>1) Package the dats into their appropriate ZIPs. Naming
standard as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>MAME Artwork 20020916 (cm).zip - CMPro</li>
    <li>MAME Artwork 20020916 (rc).zip - RomCenter</li>
</ul>

<p>2) Update the web page XML.</p>

<p>You should test your work within the lesson 2 environment. Be
sure to check the emulator page and contents page contain the
changes that you expect.Also, remember that the dates should show
when the dat was packaged/uploaded, not when the dat was created.
;)</p>

<p>3) ZIP up the WWW/Dats/xxx directories and put them on the
FTP.</p>

<p>I'll let people pick the dats that they want to package
because duplication isn't too important right now. I think this
exercise will be of benefit to all dat creators and packagers. ;)</p>
