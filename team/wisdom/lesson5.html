<h1>Lesson 5: Nebula</h1>

<p><strong>(Posted on the list by Logiqx on Sept 20th) </strong></p>

<p>I have now added the necessary Nebula stuff to my 'Dats' and
'Dats_RC' directories (for the latest mirror of my directories,
download <a href="../download/Dats.zip">Dats.zip</a> and <a
href="../download/Dats_RC.zip">Dats_RC.zip</a>).</p>

<p>If you look at these, you will see that there are two useful
batch scripts in the 'Dats/Recent/Multi/Nebula' directory: </p>

<ul>
    <li>One to validate the auto-generated dat
        (_check_generated_dat.bat)</li>
    <li>One to validate mine (_check_logiqx_dat.bat).</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading the logs is a little confusing but they are still
unbelievably useful for identifying which games need looking at!
As you can see, the Nebula generated dat contains loads of errors
but mine shows none. ;) </p>

<p>The games listed in the log for my dat are CPS-2 clones
(listed because drivers don't specify all parent ROMs) and
PGM/Konami games (since they do not have drivers). Unfortuntately
we are stuck with that little annoyance.</p>

<p>Obviously, the proof of the pudding is to validate a ROM
collection within Nebula itself (I check a full set of ROMs using
the full dat and MAME/supplement ROMs to check the supplement
dat). Doing so within Nebula shows all games as green for me. </p>

<p>There were a few driver errors causing name conflicts in
Nebula so I fixed them and sent the fixes to ElSemi. Hopefully
they will be in the next release of Nebula.</p>
