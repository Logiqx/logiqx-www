<h2>About</h2>

MSieve is a little application which loads a MAME-style XML file (in other
words, the output of "MAME -listxml") and allows you to filter out games based
on a configurable filter. Then you can save the resulting list in various
formats.<br>
<br>
Features:<br>
<ul>
<li>Easy usage (less than 150 lines of documentation, if you wanna read).</li>
<li>Fast XML parsing (2-3mb per second in my ghetto PC) and hyperfast filtering.
</li>
<li>Filtering by screen type, orientation, number of buttons or players, and
type of controls.</li>
<li>Special support for filtering by cocktail (incomplete due to MAME
limitations).</li>
<li>Four saving formats: MAME32 ini folder, Raw list, Title list, and
Tab-delimited text file.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Although the application is not polished, I'm releasing it now as a 'public
testing version'. Maybe in a near future, I'll add a couple more features and
some polishment. Until then, MSieve works and can be used without problem.<br>
