<h2>About</h2>

DupeCRCDetect is a little utility which scans folders and shows the duplicate
files it finds. I wrote it for myself, to help me organize and clean large
collections of files, like images, lyrics, etc.<br>
<br>
DupeCRCDetect works by calculating the CRC32 of the possible duplicates. A CRC32
is some kind of a checksum which is not designed to, but can be used to identify
file contents. So if two files have the same CRC32, then there's a great chance
that they have the same contents.<br>
<br>
DupeCRCDetect has many functionalities designed to help managing large amounts
of duplicates in different folders. Some of its functions have little use and
others are for every day. Little tricks are hiding around the corner, so you
only have to start using the program to learn a few ways of making your
duplicated-life easy.<br>
<br>
Use DupeCRCDetect with care, anyway. It allows to delete files from your hard
disk, and any tool which allows you to do these things is inherently dangerous.<br>
<br>
Just a final note: when working with large amounts of files, DupeCRCDetect can
be quite slow. Your mileage will vary depending on your computer. Also note that
DupeCRCDetect doesn't calculate the CRC of all the files; just files which can
have duplicates. It's magic.<br>
<br>
<h2>Explanation & Usage</h2>

DupeCRCDetect keeps an internal list of files. You can decide which files are
in it, by adding or removing entire folders. Every button and list in the GUI
has most of these hints.<br>
<br>
Button 'Add...' adds a folder, and all of its files, to the internal list.
Manually adding folders is kind of ugly (the control is awful, but does it the
way I want), you're encouraged to use drag & drop instead. If you're adding a
folder which is the parent of any subfolder already added, the child
subfolders are deleted from the list (but the files are kept).<br>
<br>
Button 'Remove' deletes an already added folder from the list. You have to
select a folder to be able to delete it. All the files from it are removed from
the internal list.<br>
<br>
Button 'Exclude...' excludes from the internal list any files which are in the
folder which you select. It doesn't remove the folder from the list, just the
files. This allows good flexibility with the 'Reload' button.<br>
<br>
Button 'Reload' cleans the internal file list and reloads all folders in the
list, again. So any excluded files are reintroduced. Or after a run of 'Find
Dupes', you can start from zero again.<br>
<br>
Button 'Find Dupes' removes from the internal file list all the unique files,
and presents the list of duplicated files, along with their sizes and CRC's.<br>
<br>
Button 'Delete!' actually deletes the selected files from your hard disk. Use
with care. It prompts for confirmation. After file deletion, the duplicates
are refreshed again. If a file selected to be deleted is still not being
deleted, it's probably because the file is somehow locked or it's read-only.
For security reasons, I decided to not force the deletion of read-only files.
Change the files attributes if you want to delete them from DupeCRCDetect.<br>
<br>
Button 'Remove' removes selected filenames from the list, and duplicates are
refreshed. It doesn't delete the files. Useful if you want to discard some
of the duplicates, without actually deleting the files.<br>
<br>
Button 'Select All' just selects every file.<br>
<br>
Button 'Select Odd' selects one from each two files. Note that given any list
of duplicates sorted by CRC, there are always at least two files for each
given CRC. Thus, selecting one from each two, and deleting them, leaves at
least one file of each given CRC. Note: Using 'Select Odd' changes the sorting
to CRC.<br>
<br>
Button 'Safe Sel' allows safe selection. It ensures that for each CRC, there's
at least one file not selected. So if you select everything, and then use this
button, you can safely delete the selected files because you'll still keep at
least one file of each CRC. Note: Using 'Select Odd' changes the sorting
to CRC.<br>
<br>
Button 'Invert' inverts the current selection. Easy and not really useful,
except in very specific circumstances. If you ever get to use it, then you'll
know what specific circumstances they are ^_^<br>
<br>
Note that the file list shown can be sorted by Name, Size or CRC just by
clicking the correspondent column header. You can select/deselect more than
one file pressing Control or Shift, just like in Windows Explorer. You can also
double-click the column header separators to adjust the width of the column to
that of the longest item in that column.<br>
<br>
If you happen to have a shortcut to DupeCRCDetect in the desktop, like I have,
then you can drag any folder(s) over the icon and DupeCRCDetect will add them
to the internal list on load. Just send as many folder names in the command
line as you want.<br>
<br>
Finally, DupeCRCDetect supports drag & drop of folders from Windows Explorer
or the desktop during run-time. Just drop the folders over the folders list
box and they will be added. These two extra methods of adding folders are the
preferred ones, and they follow the rules of the manual 'Add...' button above.<br>
<br>
<h2>Current Issues</h2>

When you close the application while it's calculating the CRC of a file, you
have to wait until the file finishes. This can be a bummer for large files.<br>
<br>
Since excluding folders is just a temporal change of the internal file list,
there's no management of excluded folders planned. Excluded folders aren't kept
anywhere and when you reload folders, all files are readded again, without
exclusions. This is the intended behaviour.<br>
<br>
I don't plan to add any 'Cancel' button, really.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the application crashes when closing it. See if you can reproduce the
crash in a consistent way and report it to me so I can fix it.<br>

<br>
Simple license: DupeCRCDetect is free for personal use, free to distribute, but
it can't be sold or used in commercial environments. Feel free to consider
donating a small amount of money to me via PayPal if you find DupeCRCDetect
useful, specially if you're a company or a rich individual ;) However, it's not
a requirement, and it will never be.<br>
<br>
DupeCRCDetect is written in Object Pascal and built with Delphi 7. It's
available at <a href=http://www.borland.com>www.borland.com</a>, either in Trial mode, or in Personal Edition
which is completely free to keep and use forever. Check out also projects like
Free Pascal and Lazarus if you're interested in Object Pascal free development.<br>
<br>
DupeCRCDetect also uses a few functions and components from the Jedi Code
Library and the Jedi Visual Component Library, best known as JCL and JVCL. These
libraries are really great if you want to code cool apps in any Delphi version.
They're available at <a href=http://www.delphi-jedi.org>www.delphi-jedi.org</a>. Thanks to the JEDI community for these
wonderful libraries.<br>
<br>
I'm not planning to release the source, but you can ask for it politely. I
don't plan to add anything else, and although the app is quite unoptimized, it
does its job well, and I don't tend to aaronize the code after a second
rewrite. However if anyone can come up with a good bug or idea, I'll think about
implementing it, or fixing. You can contact me at <b>pi 'at' logiqx 'dot' com</b>.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Bitxo & Attradis for betatesting this little utility so I can release
it to the public.<br>
