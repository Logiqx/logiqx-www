      <p align="center">I have updated my guide about compiling <a href="../HowTo/WinMAME.shtml">WinMAME

      Hopefully it is now a little clearer about how you can use new versions of
      the various tools when they are released.<br>
      The guide has been tested using the older versions of the tools (available
      at CAESAR) and also the latest versions at SourceForge, etc.&nbsp;
