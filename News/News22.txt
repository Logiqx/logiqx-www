          Welcome to the new look site!
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been wanting to do this for ages but it's always been beneath the CAESAR rewrite on my (never ending) todo list. ;)
        </p>

        <p>
	  It may not look massively different but there are a number of improvements for you guys:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Slightly different look (e.g. it has turned blue) and no more annoying frames</li>
          <li>Simpler URLs (e.g. http://www.logiqx.com/Tools/DatUtil/)</li>
          <li>Links to individual pages are better, due to the removal of frames</li>
          <li>You can still use any old URLs that you have for a while (to minimise transitional problems)</li>
          <li>Fully XHTML compliant and use of CSS throughout</li>
        </ul>
