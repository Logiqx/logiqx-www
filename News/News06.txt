        - Added 'ignore funny size' option (-z) for non-arcade
        dats.<br />
        - Added 'make lower case' option (-l). Affects names and

        spaces.<br />

        <p>29 today... into the last year of my twenties!</p>

        <p>I am looking for one or two people that can assist me in
        posting arcade related news items for <a href=
        "http://caesar.logiqx.com">CAESAR</a>. It would be nice if
        I can take a break occasionally and have people keep an eye
        out for emulator releases whilst I'm away (obviously
        important I don't miss anything for CAESAR's sake). If you
        think you could help me out then please drop me an e-mail
        and I'll explain the methods for monitoring web pages
        etc.</p>

        <p>I also start a new job soon so my spare time will be
        greatly reduced and I will be looking to get a couple of
        helpers together for the dat maintenance (hence the
        <a href="DatFAQs/">FAQ</a> I wrote about them). If
        you have read my FAQ and understand it completely then I
        would also like to hear from you if you wish to join up.
        The most common dat updates are CPS-2 related (every week)
        so it would be helpful if I could have one person
        responsible for each emulator and prepare dats for me so I
        can update the site quickly and not waste too much of my
        precious time. Please only offer your services if you're
        sure you are up to it though!</p>
