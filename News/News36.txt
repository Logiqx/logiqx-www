    <td><p>I have uploaded another update to the datafiles for SEGA Model 2 Emulator v0.9. This update includes the redumped sound ROM for Sega Water Ski, resulting in fully working sound.<br /><br />Also receiving a minor update is the datafile for FBA v0.2.97.02 which now includes all of the missing SHA-1 information.<br /><br />Finally, I have removed the RomCenter 2 datafiles from my site. The generic XML datafiles work for CMPro and RomCenter 3 and there is no reason to spend the effort generating datafiles for RomCenter 2. No-one should still be using RomCenter 2 anymore. ;)</p></td>
