<p align="center">I wrote a document sometime in January 2001 to help out a few
people who could compile MAME but also wanted to compile RAINE. At that time, MAME and
RAINE needed different versions of Allegro (A Low Level Game Routines Library) so I wrote
the documents in such a way that MAME and RAINE could easily be compiled without the need
for two separate DJGPP environments. The latest documents now explain how to
compile the Windows versions of MAME and RAINE with a single MinGW
environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">Important: These documents have been well tested by various
non-development members of the RAINE team. I have released them in the hope that you may
find them useful and to give you a better understanding of MinGW. If you have difficulties
in understanding these instructions then please don't mail me directly asking for help as
I am usually too busy to answer! I am sure you will find suitable assistance in the MAME and
RAINE message boards.</p>

<p align="center">List&nbsp; below is an old document explaining how to download
the RAINE source from SourceForge.<br>
However, I suggest that you do not use this guide and just download the source
from the <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target="_blank">RAINE</a> home page!</p>
<p align="center"><a href="Downloading.shtml">Downloading the RAINE source using
CVS</a> or using <a href="jCVS.shtml">jCVS ( JAVA CVS</a>)</p>
