<p align="center">I wrote these documents sometime in January 2001 to help out a few
people who could compile MAME but also wanted to compile RAINE. At that time, MAME and
RAINE needed different versions of Allegro (A Low Level Game Routines Library) so I wrote
the documents in such a way that MAME and RAINE could easily be compiled without the need
for two separate DJGPP environments. Although both MAME and RAINE sometimes use
the same version of Allegro
I have retained instructions for swapping in/out a particular version as it is
a useful trick to know.</p>

<p align="center">A DJGPP environment created using these instructions is also suitable
for compiling all of my tools and various other emulators such as VAntAGE.</p>

<p align="center">Important: These documents have been well tested by various
non-development members of the RAINE team. I have released them in the hope that you may
find them useful and to give you a better understanding of DJGPP. If you have difficulties
in understanding these instructions then please don't mail me directly asking for help as
I am overworked as it is! I am sure you will find suitable assistance in the MAME and
RAINE message boards.</p>
