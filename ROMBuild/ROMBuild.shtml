<p align="left">ROMBuild is a ROM manipulation tool that is capable of creating ROMs for
the older arcade emus using MAME ones. An example of this is by splitting ROMs in two or
joining two together but ROMBuild supports much more than this. It can can split, join,
extract, fill, patch, pad, interleave etc but to you the user that doesn't really matter.
The important thing is that MAME ROMs go in and ROMs for another emulator come out. :)</p>

<p align="left">When used in conjunction with the <a href="../Dats/Dats.shtml">CMPro/ROMCenter
dats</a> that I have produced you can generate ROM sets for practically any emulator from
MAME ROMs. In fact, the only ROMs you can't generate from MAME sets are where MAME doesn't
support the game.</p>
