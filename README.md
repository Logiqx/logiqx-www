# Logiqx WWW

This project includes my original development environment for the website hosted on [Logiqx.com](http://www.logiqx.com).

All of the code was originally tracked / managed locally using CVS but I have decided to upload it to GitHub.

The migration process has been [documented](Migration.md) should you be interested in how I migrated from CVS to Git.
