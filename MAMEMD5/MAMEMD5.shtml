<p align="left">Emulators like MAME often use the CRC32 algorithm to identify game ROMs and I
sometimes wonder whether there are any conflicts yet (i.e. where two differing ROMs have the same CRC). MAMEMD5 has been written to find this out!<br>
<br>
Although CRC32 is extremely good for checking if a file has been corrupted during transmission (there is only a 1 in 4 billion chance of a corruption not
affecting the CRC) the chance of two files in a large group having CRCs that match is actually higher than expected.</p>
<p align="left">For MAME v0.54 I calculate a probability of 34.119769% (when
considering complemented CRC functionality which effectively doubles the
number of CRCs used). However, this is ignoring the ROM sizes which being known reduce these odds to
4.000046%. Rob has kindly drawn up some pretty charts to show the
probability in relation to the number of ROMs; you can choose between a <a href="CRC-32%20-%20MAME%200.54%20-%20NicestCloseUp.png">close
up</a> or <a href="CRC-32%20-%20MAME%200.54%20-%20NicestFull.png">overall</a> view.</p>
<p align="left">There are just two ROMs in MAME that currently share the
same CRC (albeit through complementing):</p>
<p align="left">chukatai: 128KB ROM with CRC of 6cb1e8fc<br>
ninjemak/youma: 32KB ROM with CRC of 934e1703 (which has a complement of
6cb1e8fc)</p>
<p align="left">What I am more interested to know is if any games have ROMs with
the same size and matching CRCs but differing contents. It is also possible that
non-genuine files have accidentally got into the scene and this tool should spot
them. If you run MAMEMD5 over your sets and it reports some kind of discrepancy
then you have found what I wish to know!

<p align="center"><strong><u>8 September 2001</u></strong> - Released MAMEMD5
v1.2.</p>

<p align="center">No functional changes (there's no need to re-check your ROMs).<br>
            Added a summary showing the number recognised/unrecognised ROMs.<br>
            Added an extra message about when corrupted zip data is found.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>7 September 2001</u></strong> - Released MAMEMD5
v1.1.</p>

<p align="center">Sorry, I introduced a really silly bug into v1.0 so it will
miss some collisions.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>5 September 2001</u></strong> - Released MAMEMD5 v1.0.</p>
